# MOQ Notes


- When you're stuck you need new hypotheses. Where do you get them?
  - Scientific method won't work
  - Disinterested observation is silly
  - You have to select the right facts you have to care
  - Traditional rationality separate out the idea of quality. It keeps us stuck.
  - The leading edge of the train is where all the action is. It's next step be the next step along quality in. If you don't take the quality track you are derailed. Substitute wholeness for quality.
  - Reality is dynamic. And when you deal with a dynamic reality you never get stuck.
  - When you get stuck on the screw you not have an opportunity to understand that the screw is more the category screw that you created it's all the functions of the screw it's all the future direction of the screw is all the possibilities where can you find the most quality?
- Discussion of quality in the making process
  - The ugliness has neither to do with the subject or the object i.e. the material or the maker
  - At the point of quality the subject of the object identical
  - Modern technological production excludes this quality of the joint
  - The wholeness function takes into account the wholeness of the item in the whole list of the things around it. Maybe this is just the relationship between what's already there to what is being created. Could there be an inherent quality that is based on the person producing it? Or must we require that everything be made in accordance with what came before.
  - Traditional instructions give you either the romantic way to fix something or the classic way of fixing something. You need both.
  - Stylizing something is just making funny romantic quality is not actually in it.
- If Art is the towel it must incorporate art science and religion
  - Art is the god head revealed in man
  - The idea that science and or technology has no quality and it has got to go
    - Geometry is not true it is convenient.
    - There's a hierarchy of facts the more general the fact the more precious
    - When quality enters the picture the preselection of facts is no longer biases. It is based on quality ie reality.
  - Care is associated with quality. One who pays attention to quality as they work cares.
- That was helps us interpret the quality cannot be brought into the world and defined.
- Quality is what helps us develop the analogues for everything science, architecture, music etc.
- Quality generates everything.
- Quality produces the subject and the object. It is the point where they meet before the mind knows what each is.
- Quality is neither of the mind North matter is a third thing entirely.
- Quality-if you can't define it what makes you think it exists? Realism a thing exists if the world around it cannot function without it.  If we can show that a world without quality does not perform normally we have proven that quality exists.
- Absence of quality is squareness. Rationality is the only thing that does not require quality

- Good is a noun. That was it. That was what Phædrus had been looking for. That was the homer, over the fence, that ended the ball game. Good as a noun rather than as an adjective is all the Metaphysics of Quality is about. Of course, the ultimate Quality isn’t a noun or an adjective or anything else definable, but if you had to reduce the whole Metaphysics of Quality to a single sentence, that would be it.

- The whole world. If you look at the lives of some of the great moral figures of history— Christ, Lincoln, Gandhi, and others— you’ll see that that’s what they were really involved in, the cleansing of the world through the absorption of karmic garbage. They didn’t pass it on. Their followers sometimes did, but they didn’t.

  - ...They absorb the centers, as broken as they are, and keep strengthening the rest.
- While sustaining biological and social patterns Kill all intellectual patterns. Kill them completely And then follow Dynamic Quality And morality will be served.

- The explanation for this contradiction is the belief that you do not free yourself from static patterns by fighting them with other contrary static patterns. That is sometimes called “bad karma chasing its tail.” You free yourself from static patterns by putting them to sleep.

- There’s an adage that, “Nothing disturbs a bishop quite so much as the presence of a saint in the parish.” It was one of Phædrus’s favorites. The saint’s Dynamic understanding makes him unpredictable and uncontrollable, but the bishop’s got a whole calendar of static ceremonies to attend to; fund-raising projects to push forward, bills to pay, parishioners to meet. That saint’s going to up-end everything if he isn’t handled diplomatically. And even then he may do something wildly unpredictable that upsets everybody. What a quandary!

- The Metaphysics of Quality says that it is immoral for sane people to force cultural conformity by suppressing the Dynamic drives that produce insanity. Such suppression is a lower form of evolution trying to devour a higher one. Static social and intellectual patterns are only an intermediate level of evolution. They are good servants of the process of life but if allowed to turn into masters they destroy it.

- There’s nothing about insanity that conforms to any scientific law of the universe. The scientific laws of the universe are invented by sanity.

- It is immoral to speak against a people because of the color of their skin, or any other genetic characteristic because these are not changeable and don’t matter anyway. But it is not immoral to speak against a person because of his cultural characteristics if those cultural characteristics are immoral. These are changeable and they do matter.

- Only social patterns can control biological patterns, and the instrument of conversation between society and biology is not words. The instrument of conversation between society and biology has always been a policeman or a soldier and his gun. All the laws of history, all the arguments, all the Constitutions and the Bills of Rights and Declarations of Independence are nothing more than instructions to the military and police.

- The idea that biological crimes can be ended by intellect alone, that you can talk crime to death, doesn’t work.
  - Pirsig, Robert (2013-11-06). Lila: An Inquiry Into Morals (Kindle Locations 5308-5309). Random House Publishing Group. Kindle Edition.
- When society undermines intellectual freedom for its own purposes it is absolutely morally bad, but when it represses biological freedom for its own purposes it is absolutely morally good. These moral bads and goods are not just “customs.” They are as real as rocks and trees.

- What the Metaphysics of Quality concludes is that the old Puritan and Victorian social codes should not be followed blindly, but should not be attacked blindly either. They should be dusted off and re-examined, fairly and impartially, to see what they were trying to accomplish and what they actually did accomplish toward building a stronger society.
  - Pirsig, Robert (2013-11-06). Lila: An Inquiry Into Morals (Kindle Locations 5295-5297). Random House Publishing Group. Kindle Edition.
- Today we are living in an intellectual and technological paradise and a moral and social nightmare because the intellectual level of evolution, in its struggle to become free of the social level, has ignored the social level’s role in keeping the biological level under control. Intellectuals have failed to understand the ocean of biological quality that is constantly being suppressed by social order. Biological quality is necessary to the survival of life. But when it threatens to dominate and destroy society, biological quality becomes evil itself, the “Great Satan” of twentieth-century Western culture.

- The Hippie rejection of social and intellectual patterns left just two directions to go: toward biological quality and toward Dynamic Quality. The revolutionaries of the sixties thought that since both are antisocial, and since both are anti-intellectual, why then they must both be the same. That was the mistake.
  - Pirsig, Robert (2013-11-06). Lila: An Inquiry Into Morals (Kindle Locations 5190-5193). Random House Publishing Group. Kindle Edition.
- The Metaphysics of Quality says there are not just two codes of morals, there are actually five: inorganic-chaotic, biological-inorganic, social-biological, intellectual-social, and Dynamic-static. This last, the Dynamic-static code, says what’s good in life isn’t defined by society or intellect or biology. What’s good is freedom from domination by any static pattern, but that freedom doesn’t have to be obtained by the destruction of the patterns themselves.
  - Pirsig, Robert (2013-11-06). Lila: An Inquiry Into Morals (Kindle Locations 5150-5154). Random House Publishing Group. Kindle Edition.
- Intellect can support static patterns of society without fear of domination by carefully distinguishing those moral issues that are social-biological from those that are intellectual-social and making sure there is no encroachment either way.
  - Pirsig, Robert (2013-11-06). Lila: An Inquiry Into Morals (Kindle Locations 5143-5145). Random House Publishing Group. Kindle Edition.
- “What is the purpose of all this intellectual knowledge?” the Metaphysics of Quality answers, “The fundamental purpose of knowledge is to Dynamically improve and preserve society.”
  - Pirsig, Robert (2013-11-06). Lila: An Inquiry Into Morals (Kindle Locations 5135-5137). Random House Publishing Group. Kindle Edition.
- Once this political battle is resolved, the Metaphysics of Quality can then go back and re-ask the question, “Just exactly how independent is science, in fact, from society?” The answer it gives is, “not at all.” ....is as unreal and absurd as a society in which biological patterns are of no account. It’s an impossibility.
  - Pirsig, Robert (2013-11-06). Lila: An Inquiry Into Morals (Kindle Locations 5114-5116). Random House Publishing Group. Kindle Edition.
- There was no way you could beat a Victorian on manners and there was no way you could beat a twentieth-century intellectual on causes.

- idea. But having said this, the Metaphysics of Quality goes on to say that science, the intellectual pattern that has been appointed to take over society, has a defect in it. The defect is that subject-object science has no provision for morals. Subject-object science is only concerned with facts. Morals have no objective reality.
  - Pirsig, Robert (2013-11-06). Lila: An Inquiry Into Morals (Kindle Locations 4781-4783). Random House Publishing Group. Kindle Edition.
- Once intellect has been let out of the bottle of social restraint, it is almost impossible to put it back in again. And it is immoral to try.

- As Edith Wharton said, Victorians feared scandal worse than they feared disease. They had lost their faith in the religious values of their ancestors and put their faith in society instead. It was only by wearing the corset of society that one kept oneself from lapsing back into a condition of evil.

- Phædrus remembered now that it had bothered him a little that in The Odyssey Homer seemed at times to be equating Quality and celebrity. Perhaps in Homer’s time, when evolution had not yet transcended the social level into the intelectual, the two were the same.

- This is really the central problem in the static-Dynamic conflict of evolution: how do you tell the saviors from the degenerates?

- Robert’s Rules of Order that seemed to capture the whole thing in two sentences: No minority has a right to block a majority from conducting the legal business of the organization. No majority has a right to prevent a minority from peacefully attempting to become a majority.

- Science always contains an eraser, a mechanism whereby new Dynamic
- insight could wipe out old static patterns without destroying science itself. Thus science, unlike orthodox theology, has been capable of continuous, evolutionary growth. As Phædrus had written on one of his slips, “The pencil is mightier than the pen.”
  - Pirsig, Robert (2013-11-06). Lila: An Inquiry Into Morals (Kindle Locations 3862-3864). Random House Publishing Group. Kindle Edition.
  - This is what hypercatallaxy gives to the market, an eraser with out having to erase the previous advancments.
- A free market is a Dynamic institution. What people buy and what people sell, in other words what people value, can never be contained by any intellectual formula.
  - Pirsig, Robert (2013-11-06). Lila: An Inquiry Into Morals (Kindle Locations 3841-3843). Random House Publishing Group. Kindle Edition.
  - What about an intellectual formula that is dynamic as well?
  - In the same way that amino acids bootstraped on top of carbon and became more dynamic, we need to bootstrap a market on top of society something that is more dynamic than just 'the market'
- From a Metaphysics of Quality’s point of view this devouring of human bodies is a moral activity because it’s more moral for a social pattern to devour a biological pattern than for a biological pattern to devour a social pattern. A social pattern is a higher form of evolution.
  - Pirsig, Robert (2013-11-06). Lila: An Inquiry Into Morals (Kindle Locations 3820-3821). Random House Publishing Group. Kindle Edition.
- This city is a higher pattern than either a substance or a biological pattern called man. Just as biology exploits substance for its own purposes, so does this social pattern called a city exploit biology for its own purposes. Just as a farmer raises cows for the sole purpose of devouring them, this pattern grows living human bodies for the sole purpose of devouring them.
  - Pirsig, Robert (2013-11-06). Lila: An Inquiry Into Morals (Kindle Locations 3793-3796). Random House Publishing Group. Kindle Edition.
- If “man” invented societies and cities, why are all societies and cities so repressive of “man”?
  - Pirsig, Robert (2013-11-06). Lila: An Inquiry Into Morals (Kindle Location 3775). Random House Publishing Group. Kindle Edition.
  - There is a society layer bootstrapped from the biological layer and a society layer bootstrapped from the intelectual layer. They need separate names -AAf
- That’s what this whole century’s been about, this struggle between intellectual and social patterns.
- In general, given a choice of two courses to follow and all other things being equal, that choice which is more Dynamic, that is, at a higher level of evolution, is more moral. An example of this is the statement that, “It’s more moral for a doctor to kill a germ than to allow the germ to kill his patient.” The germ wants to live. The patient wants to live. But the patient has moral precedence because he’s at a higher
- In the Metaphysics of Quality there’s the morality called the “laws of nature,” by which inorganic patterns triumph over chaos; there is a morality called the “law of the jungle” where biology triumphs over the inorganic forces of starvation and death; there’s a morality where social patterns triumph over biology, “the law”; and there is an intellectual morality, which is still struggling in its attempts to control society. Each of these sets of moral codes is no more related to the other than novels are to flip-flops.
- Of course it sounds peculiar at first and awkward and unnecessary to say that hydrogen and oxygen form water because it is moral to do so. But it is no less peculiar and awkward and unnecessary than to say chemistry professors smoke pipes and go to movies because irresistible cause-and-effect forces of the cosmos force them to do it....moral= increasing wholeness.
- If each level bootstraps up a new vein of quality to optimize around...that may be where the generative languages come from...rather that may be the generative language.
- Therefore to say that the world is nothing but value is just confusing, not clarifying. Now this vagueness is removed by sorting out values according to levels of evolution. The value that holds a glass of water together is an inorganic pattern of value. The value that holds a nation together is a social pattern of value....These patterns have nothing in common except the historic evolutionary process that created all of them. But that process is a process of value evolution. Therefore the name “static pattern of values” applies to all.
- Certainly the novel cannot exist in the computer without a parallel pattern of voltages to support it. But that does not mean that the novel is an expression or property of those voltages.
- In this plain of understanding static patterns of value are divided into four systems: inorganic patterns, biological patterns, social patterns and intellectual patterns....But although the four systems are exhaustive they are not exclusive. They all operate at the same time and in ways that are almost independent of each other. ... It says they are not continuous. They are discrete. They have very little to do with one another. Although each higher level is built on a lower one it is not an extension of that lower level. Quite the contrary. The higher level can often be seen to be in opposition to the lower level, dominating it, controlling it where possible for its own purposes.
- What the Dynamic force had to invent in order to move up the molecular level and stay there was a carbon molecule that would preserve its limited Dynamic freedom from inorganic laws and at the same time resist deterioration back to simple compounds of carbon again.
- Biological evolution can be seen as a process by which weak Dynamic forces at a subatomic level discover stratagems for overcoming huge static inorganic forces at a superatomic level. They do this by selecting superatomic mechanisms in which a number of options are so evenly balanced that a weak Dynamic force can tip the balance one way or another. The particular atom that the weak Dynamic subatomic forces have seized as their primary vehicle is carbon. .... Phædrus thought this ambiguity of carbon’s bonding preferences was the situation the weak Dynamic subatomic forces needed.
- Natural selection is Dynamic Quality at work. There is no quarrel whatsoever between the Metaphysics of Quality and the Darwinian Theory of Evolution. - contrast this with yudikowski's blind God version of natural selection.
- The reason atoms become chemistry professors has got to be that something in nature does not like laws of chemical equilibrium or the law of gravity or the laws of thermodynamics or any other law that restricts the molecules’ freedom. They only go along with laws ofany kind because they have to, preferring an existence that does not follow any laws whatsoever.
- Naturally there is no mechanism toward which life is heading. Mechanisms are the enemy of life. The more static and unyielding the mechanisms are, the more life works to evade them or overcome them. - not sue if I believe this....it may not be an evading, but a strengthening of already developed centers.
- “All life is a migration of static patterns of quality toward Dynamic Quality.”
- Although Dynamic Quality, the Quality of freedom, creates this world in which we live, these patterns of static quality, the quality of order, preserve our world.
- Dynamic Quality is the pre-intellectual cutting edge of reality, the source of all things, completely simple and always new.
- ...to do what is reasonable even when it isn't any good
- The mythos is insane
- Mu answers
- The track of quality preselects which facts we are going to be conscious of to harmonize what we are  with what we are becoming.
- What the Metaphysics of Quality would do is take this separate category, Quality, and show how it contains within itself both subjects and objects.
- Patterns of culture do not operate in accordance with the laws of physics. How are you going to prove in terms of the laws of physics that a certain attitude exists within a culture?
- Data without generalization is just gossip.

Yes, Kantian experience - which I take to be equal to awareness - is
dependent upon the time/space/causation (TSC) framework that is 100%
true. Yes, TSC IS experience in the SOM (mind) sense, but MOQ's claim
is that experience=value and that shifts the ground totally. If you
have followed my SOTAQI idea and drop the Intellect=mind (-as-
different-from-matter) idea and equalize Q-Intellect with
subject-object thinking (awareness of self as subject (different from
objects [other]) then time, space and causation can be seen as the
first SO ideas that arose intricately interwoven with language and
became the cornerstones upon which the intellectual edifice rose
......to the height of a skyscraper; it became the whole of reality:
A METAPHYSICS!!!!
This is in SOM-lingo called "ability to think", "awareness",
"sentience" or "consciousness", all with a ring of absolute to them
....knowledge of good and evil.... in religious terms", but the
Q-metaphysics takes it down a notch and tucks it in under itself. As
the top static level admittedly, but subservient to the overall
Quality system.

"Dynamic Quality is a constant, these static patterns are different for everyone because each person has a different static pattern of life history. Both the Dynamic Quality and the static patterns influence his final judgment. That is why there is some uniformity among individual value judgments but not complete uniformity." -SODV

If alexander is right, then the wholness laws drow ta unity around the dynamic quality.  Each subject in the system may have different histories, and may have a different perfered path to increase the whoness, but but the system as a whole has a 'more whonless direction and aless whonless direction'  The system needs to move toward wholeness.
