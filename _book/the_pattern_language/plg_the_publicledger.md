# PLG. Public Ledger

... How can capital **(CAP)**, both artificial **(ACP)** and real **(RCP)** be tracked. How can we hold accountable those that enforce rule of law **(LAW)** and support public transparency **(TRN)**. How can we track the movement of Supply, Demand and Price **(SDP)** in a Market **(MKT)**? How can we support, enforce and celebrate the paying of taxes **(TAX)**.  How can we strengthen the predistribution of economic rents **(PRF)** and money's resistance to counterfeiting **(RTC)**.

**One of the critical weaknesses of our current cash is its ability to move outside of regulated channels via paper money.  It is used to support black market activities and to avoid the paying of taxes.**

Our system will provide for a 'public ledger' that shows all transactions from one wallet to another. This data will be mine-able and discover-able.

This will allow us to secure the rights to assets via the rule of law.  Center to this is the tracking of the Prefs that have been issued to a wallet.  When an account wants to spend money, accept money, or claim pref payments, they will need to 'catch up' and distribute a portion of the demurrage to pref owners in there account.  Because all prefs are logged in the public ledger this is easy.

In addition to transaction fundamentals (how much, to who), parties will be able to attach meta-data to their transactions.  Serial numbers of purchased goods can be tracked in a similar way to how property transactions are tracked in the  county courthouses around the country.  Title insurance will no longer be necessary.

What about privacy?  There are certainly instance where a citizen would not want to have a transaction public due to the sensitive nature of the transaction. Later we will discuss the solution to this problem in Privacy and Private Dispersal.

Because these private transactions will be handled differently we can provide a right to use them, but also tax them if they lead to a drain on society or are suspected of leading to nefarious activity.

Because private transactions will take extra time to anonymity, we may not be able to provide instant transfer

Certain account types may be restricted from using private transactions.  For example, corporations and/or the state should not be allowed to use such types of transactions.  Privacy should be a right reserved for citizen type accounts only.

How can we secure the public ledger?  Using cyptocurrency style security we can secure blocks of transactions, and distribute the keys to the public.  By doing so, a nefarious entity will not be able to 'rollback' transactions or double spend. When, via the rule of law, a change to the ledger needs to be made, it must be done via a correction entry and will be subject to democratic veto.

Therefore:

**Develop a public ledger system that protects the rights of citizens for privacy but also allows for the registering of ownership.**

----------

The public Ledger helps enable Everyone is a bank **(BNK)** and Human Dignity Services **(DIG)** Included in the public ledger is the fact that Privacy and Private Dispersal **(PRI)** helps secure the right to privacy for the citizen **(CTZ)**. The public ledger helps secure the right to the full output of labor for the citizen **(FOL)**.  Correction records should be subject to democratic veto **(VTO)**.
