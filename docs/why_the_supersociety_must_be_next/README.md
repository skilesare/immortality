# Why the supersociety must be next

Because intellect already exists, and because the intelligence bootstrap will rely on observations, we have to get the supersocity bootstrap right or the superintellegence will avoid repeating our observation.(not good)


A super society where resources are pursued by individuals according to personal need, but that produces a sustainable redistribution via those personal needs(catallaxy) is the highest quality form of resource allocation.  Under this form of society, dynamic quality will have the freedom to shift and flow without the underlying structure being destroyed.  When the dynamic quality finds a wholeness that creates a static latch we will have found a potential supersociety.  The fragility of the latch will dictate whether the bootstrap holds.  We should be seeking an antifragile static latch.  I hope that the hypercatallaxian economy would provide this antifragile latch.
