A fresh start\nLet us live as man will live in the future and think as man will think in the future.  To make any progress in this volume, you will have to set aside what has been.  This may be difficult for you as it is for me, but if we would like a fresh start at this grand life it is a step we must constantly ask ourselves to take.\nII. A philosophy\nThough I am not a scientist, this work will take a scientific tone.  I hope to point us toward a worldview where the generalizations I propose can be proven out by those better trained in the scientific arts who have more time available to them.  This leaves me with the solemn reality that this is a work of philosophy and that many of the generalizations I make will be proven scientifically unsound.  If they are, my hope is that they, at least, point in the right vector of the real and can be corrected by those wiser than I am.\nIII. The great economies\nLife is not simple, but it is more simple that it appears on the surface.  We live amongst four great economies and on the cusp of a million more.  Robert Pirsig identified these in his works of Zen and Motorcycle Maintenance and Lila.  Lila is the more important where the four economies are identified.  The economies are those of the inorganic, the biological, the societal, and the intellectual.  He does not point out that they are economies, but as we move forward we will see that this is so.  There are other lesser economies and perhaps even major ones that I do not pay enough heed to, but in thinking about the major issues that our world faces, these four seem to be enough to focus on for now. It may be that these economies are not discrete and form some kind of continuum that we cannot see easily.  I will leave this possibility to others to investigate and treat the economies as discrete for the purpose of this book. I think many of the conclusions will stand even if there is a continuous evolution of one 'kind' of development.\nIV. The bootstrap\nThe four economies did not always exist.  First the inorganic emerged after the universe cooled enough for a pattern of forces to cascade out of the primordial plasma.  Millions, maybe billions, maybe trillions of years later, some of these forces arranged themselves in such a way to replicate themselves and overcome the prevailing economy of patterned forces.\nThis new economy did not deal in the supply and demand of patterned forces.  In a sense, patterned forces bootstrapped a new economy that dealt in the supply and demand of reproductive fitness.  We call this the biological level.  The biological level often uses the inorganic level to its advantage of creating fitness.  Take a nest: the organism leverages the forces created by the nest material(the major force being the ability to keep out unwanted forces such as weather, predators, and other deadly things) to increase the reproductive fitness of the organisms raised in the nest.\nIn addition to using the inorganic level, the biological level began to use its own economy to evolve itself into a more and more adept engine for reproduction. The organic level used knowledge stored in DNA to accomplish this.\nThe bootstrap  occurs when a new economy is produced that leverages the pre-existing economies to create a new and stable economy that itself can grow and change.\nV. Two more bootstraps\nThe diaspora of what can come to be balloons in new directions with each new bootstrap.  In addition to the inorganic -> biological bootstrap, we also have the biological -> societal bootstrap and the biological -> intellectual.\nThe societal level is built on the inorganic and biological levels and deals in the economics of resources.  This is traditional economics as we know it in the 21st century.  At some point, the biological began to realize that by controlling a specific resource it could increase its fitness for itself and, potentially for many additional generations.  The original adaptation may have been to just hoard enough to get through the winter, but eventually, an economy that dealt in wealth and abundance emerged.  Like an organism building a nest, an organism that builds a society is protecting itself from the need to evolve at the biological level. Society tends to slow down evolution because the organism can assure the survival of its genes by means other than biological adaptation. The knowledge for humans to excel in the economy of resources is encoded in the memes that make up various aspects of our culture.\nThe intellectual level is built on the biological platform, but also has the advantage of bootstrapping after the societal level and thus has access to that infrastructure as well.  The intellectual deals in an economy of time-shifted reproduction of phenomena.  This is quite a mouthful, but what I mean is, in a sense, science.  The ability to anticipate the outcome of an action, and to trigger that action is not a given.  It is a development that is dependent on the intellectual level developing.  This ability generates things like language.  When I shout 'Duck!' I expect to get a certain response from those around me.  If I shout Duck! Quack, Quack! I will have an anticipation of what will be in other's heads in these two different circumstances. We accumulate the knowledge needed to excel at this level in symbols that we put down on paper or up into the internet.\nVI. A god in the dust\nPirsig proposes further a concept called Dynamic Quality that he points to as the bleeding edge of reality as we cut through time.  Pirsig is permissive with his Dynamic Quality and chooses to let it lead where it will.  I will choose to pass this dynamic quality through the lens of Christopher Alexander's Nature of Order and focus it not on a random wandering, but on a purpose-filled generation of Wholeness.\nThis is a god in the dust of everything, and not so much in the thing as in the relation of each thing to the other.  In as much as a thing hangs together with the things around it, we can see this wholeness.  When this wholeness is present, dynamic quality passes from a nebulous thing to a static quality.  An entity emerges.  Many entities emerge.\nVII. Moral Authority\nWhen we observe this pattern of bootstrap and the timescales that we currently consider to be reasonable for the age of the universe and the time taken for each bootstrap, we can make a generalization about the universe.  The universe is in the business of bootstraps.  Further, I will assume that it is a moral imperative of the universe that bootstraps occur.  Each bootstrap is an advancement and that advancement is given moral authority over the existing economies to reach a new bootstrap.\nWhat right do I have to say that morality comes into it at all?  This is a very complicated question and one that I can't answer very well.  It is simply a presupposition at this time that is drawn from the fact that we, as human beings, are the result of three bootstraps.  I will lean some on Alexander's theoretical proposal for the equation of wholeness here.  When things become a thing, it is good and right and the world is made.\nThe biological has the moral authority to attempt to overcome and even disrupt the patterned forces of the inorganic world.  Society has the moral authority to disrupt biology and shape the inorganic for its gains.  The intellectual has the authority to structure society, the manipulate biological, and subdue the inorganic to create repeatable symbolic realities.  This authority is real and it is dangerous.\nVIII.  Moral Responsibility\nThe fact that the biological system bootstrapped twice reveals a key fact about the universe that helps redeem the moral tyranny that moral authority can suggest.  If society had completely subdued biology, the intellect would have never evolved.  While society has authority over biology it also has the moral responsibility to provide for all the additional bootstrapping that these unpredictable systems may have.\nOur approach to the future must recognize the authority but must act with responsibility because we cannot predict where the next great jump may occur.\nLater will will explore some moral quandaries and show how this morality cascade gives a much more focused framework for making decisions in all things from what to have for breakfast to government policy.\nIX. What is next\nWe can make some assumptions from the bootstraps that have occurred about the bootstraps to come.  Since we have seen bootstraps from the inorganic to biological, then the biological to the societal and intellectual, we now have four leaping off points for the future.  Any of these points may be the 'next' form of technology that transforms our world.\nX. Biology II\nThe inorganic took millions of years to bootstrap to the biological, and there is no assurance that we do not have additional inorganic to X bootstraps in our future.  There are two ways this could come about: the molecular storm or design.  Biology originally fell out of the molecular storm producing self-replicating, carbon-based molecules.  It is possible that there are other kinds of self-replicating molecules that are not carbon based, or at least, not DNA/RNA based.\nInstead of waiting for the molecular storm to produce this bootstrap, it is possible that humans may design this kind of bootstrap now that we can manipulate time and 'do science.'  In fact, we have an extensive amount of speculation in this area in the realm of nanotechnology and the ideas of making self-replicating machines that are not DNA based.  I call this possibility Biology II.  Don't get hung up that this is 'one thing.'  In fact, there may be biology III, IV, and Vs.  Any instance where patterned forces emerge into a repeatable economy that isn't survival of the fittest would count as a new bootstrap.\nThere are of course dangers in this, and it is commonly referred to as the 'gray goo' scenario where a self-replicating thing just eats away at our reality.  A more likely scenario is that an emerging biology II, if engineered here in our environment, would leverage the existing infrastructure and incorporate our intelligence and society into the mix.  It certainly would have the moral authority to do so.  The question we should be concerned with is whether it would have the moral responsibility to preserve the levels that had come before it.\nXI. System III\nBiology developed two bootstraps that operate on the control of resources and the manipulation of time.  It is not unforeseeable that biology could develop a third system that dominates our world.  I consider this to be a most unlikely bootstrap in the near term as society and intellect operate together to create a rather reliable boundary around our existing biological situation.  In fact it is most likely that this System III would not evolve until we reach out to the stars and a branch of humanity becomes so isolated, and potentially regresses to a state where evolution could gain back the upper hand.\nOn the other hand, designing a system that integrates with other technologies might force a local evolution.  Consider a  scenario where we can connect our minds to a centralized network and information is instantly shared amongst all humans connected to that network.  This could force a new kind of evolution based on pre-existing biases in our biology.\nXII. Supersociety\nSociety operates on the control and efficient allocation of resources.  What happens when we get so efficient at this that a new structure begins to form on top of this reality that develops its own economy beyond the allocation of resources.  The supersociety will become the focus of this paper in the future and it is my conclusion that it is imperative that the supersociety be the next bootstrap before we reach any of the other bootstraps if we are to have hope that the current iteration of humanity is to continue on into the future, and achieve immortality.\nXIII.  Superintelligence\nContrary to popular belief, AI is not the next bootstrap.  It may bring this bootstrap along faster, but in order for real superintelligence to emerge, it must make the manipulation of time and the reproduction of experimental results so effortless and common that a new economy based on something else entirely can emerge.  I can't even comprehend what this looks likes, but it is likely that entire simulated universes will pop in and out of existence in the same way that protons and electrons break and form chemical bonds.\nImagine a universe where you can send a thousand copies of yourself on a 10,000 year journey to discover something and that that 10,000 years only seems to pass in a second for you.  After that second you have access to the vast array of knowledge that your copies amassed during that 10,000 years.\nXIV. Bleeding Edges\nPlease do not try to figure out what the next bootstrap is and then pursue that with reckless abandon.  The bleeding edge of dynamic quality cannot be predicted.  Instead, we should attempt to increase the surface area at each point in each system so that dynamic quality can have its way and find the wholeness that is produced.  This is not to say that every touch point with dynamic quality is an equal in potential to bootstrap.  In fact, some points will produce fragile economies, others robust, and finally, the ones that actually bootstrap will be antifragile.  There may be many false starts along the way.\nXV.  Latching\nThe production of new dynamic economies is not enough.  We also need these economies to stick around.  They need to not only be robust, but also antifragile and stable.  We will call these economies antifragile-stable to signify the importance of this latch.  Without the latch a new economy will break down and cease to be productive in producing the possibilities of new bootstraps.\nXVI. Toward supersociety\nMost of my focus will be on the bootstrap to the Supersociety.  In a Supersociety, the limitations of the societal economics are overcome and rendered irrelevant.  If we want our current society to continue, this needs to happen in a way that moral responsibility is invoked over moral authority.  This will allow the eventual bootstrap to superintellegence to focus on not disrupting our society even though it has the authority to do so.  We've had some practice at this with our intellectual bootstrap.  It could be said that many of our advanced intellectual constructs that have been the most successful have allowed us to maintain a diversity of societies inside of the time based intellectual construct.\nTo determine how to overcome the economics at the societal level, we must ask and understand what that economy is.  This economy is the supply and demand of resources.  We have gotten very good at allocating resources and we have created many societal and intellectual institutions to try to streamline this process.  Unfortunately, we haven't made it irrelevant yet.  Making it irrelevant would require maximizing the efficiency of our use of resources.  We've tried a few things through the years to try to do this, but most of our efforts have proven to be too fragile for reality.  Currently, capitalism rules the day with its laissez-faire approach to markets.  Even this hands-off approach has been exposed as fragile.  Communism probably took the grandest stab at this but ended up being shown as hyper-fragile.\nI will propose that the way to maximize the surface area of society is to use the tools of the intellectual economy, namely the manipulation of time and observation.  I wish we could predict the future and make the best decisions now, but that is impossible until we solve time travel.  What we can do is reliably make decisions in the future based on what happens between now and then.  Society has attempted some forms of this and in fact, contract law has been pretty successful at increasing the efficiency of our markets.  Ultimately, though, it will be the implementation of a rules-based public ledger that maximizes the efficiencies.  Today we call this the blockchain.\nXVII. An Economic Vector of Time\nJust adding a blockchain is not enough.  When one considers the reality of the societal layer of our reality, one quickly realizes that time does not play a factor.  It is hard for humans to separate time from our societal institutions because we are also intellectual beings.  Consider the study of economics and the classic idea of 'Homo Economicus.'  The entire study is based on a theoretical entity making the best decision it can with the knowledge it has on hand.  Economics doesn't allow for fudging time or for considering the completely unforeseen consequences of future time.\nSo we must also add into our public ledger a vector of reality that is time-based.  In fact the blockchain allows us to replay time and make decisions now based on what really was in the past.  This is very different from making decisions about the present based on what the people who have the most power now say happened in the past.  The blockchain keeps us honest in our replaying of the past.\nXVIII.  Hypercatallaxian Economy\nTo increase the surface area the most we need to maximize the number of antifragile-stable systems that can emerge.  To do this I propose a type of economy that I call hypercatallaxian.  The word 'catallaxy' is derived for the Greek verb katalatto, which means 'to exchange,' or 'to become reconciled with,' or 'to admit into the community,' or,'to make an enemy a friend.'(wikipedia)  Catallaxy is generally discussed as a property arising out of economy.  We take these principles and build them into the economic system to amplify them, thus, hyper.\nAt its core, this economy occurs on a public ledger.  As cash is held by an account, it begins to decay.  This decay rate incentivises a person to use or convert the cash into a capital asset as quickly as possible.  The cash does not decay into thin air.  Instead it travels back through the public ledger to those that provided the cash in proportion to the amount provided into the account.  This incentivises spenders to spend on accounts that they think will receive more cash in the future.  They are rewarded by predicting success.  Those that guess best receive a larger long term dividend than those that guess poorly.\nThe economic question transfers from a question of what can I get for my dollar today to what can I get today and who will be the best steward of it in the future.\nOver time this economy provides a meritocratic based income to all participants in proportion to how well their contributions to the economy perform in the future.\nThere are many more details that are discussed later in the pattern language in the section Art and Democratic Hypercatallaxy\nXIX. Neutralizing Risk\nEntrepreneurs across the planet are already looking for these antifragile-stable ideas but often can't find the resources to achieve them.  The resources aren't provided because the risks are too great.  Simply incentivising participants in the economy to bet on these ideas is not enough.  So to increase the flow of resources to those that seek to increase the exposure of society to the dynamic quality, we must reduce the risk of making resources available.  The blockchain allows for this by allowing us to fold the blockchain over failures in the future.  When resources go from party A to B and then out to C, D, and E, the hope is that someone along the chain makes good even if B fails miserably.  By folding A to C D and E and providing a backflow of reward through this link, we can increase the flow of capital through our societal system.  Here we find the core and justification for the hypercatallaxian system.\nXX. A demand for immortality\nOnce in a system where our future success depends on the success of those that we have contributed to in the past, and when those that have contributed to us depend on our continued success, a dynamic thing will happen.  Our deaths will be the worst thing that can happen to those that depend on us.  Under current society, our deaths are processed in a vacuum of time.  Once we reach a certain age and stage, the world has more to gain from us kicking the bucket than sticking around.  Under a hypercatallaxin system, this is no longer the case.  This dependence of continued existence will drive medical research to a level where the life expectancy begins to increase at greater than a slope of 1.  This is the beginning of immortality.  We will certainly have many opportunities to mess it up along the way, and it is in no way guaranteed, but it is at least now a road that we can point toward.\nXXI.  Conclusion\nAnd thus we have reached our conclusion of an economics toward immortality.  There is much more to discuss and much more detail to dive into.  The rest of this book goes into the details of this economics and is followed by a pattern language for implementing the economy.\n"},"a_definition_of_immortality.html":{"url":"a_definition_of_immortality.html","title":"A definition of 'immortality'","keywords":"","body":"Definitions\nA definition of 'immortality'\nWhen I speak of immortality I am speaking of a state of the universe in which an intelligence has a reasonable expectation that it will continue to exist and operate, without defect or deterioration, beyond a point in the future where technology can be expected to exist that can alleviate and heal any micro-defects.\nOn Why death is bad\nDeath is the end of a mind.  Under our current knowledge, a mind is one of the most precious resources that we have.  There are a number of metaphysical postulations and religious opinions that expect a mind to continue after death, but there is no physical evidence that this is so.\nOf course many of us have faith that the mind endures beyond death, but we also are not in a hurry to test that hypothesis.  If a divine being is at odds with us preserving our minds, it is more than welcome to intervene.\nOn Expectations\nThe immortality that I am addressing in this book is not a magical or spiritual immortality.  It is unlikely that the minds that participate in this immortality will realize that they are in that state.  This is a result of approaching the state of immortality slowly.  The mind will live for a significant amount of time with the expectation that it will die around 100.  Then, after a time that expectation will will become 150.  Then when the mind is 200 it may only expect to live another 100 years.  At 350, 1000 may seem achievable but not likely.  And so on.\nOn Accidents\nMany minds may still die.  This is due to accident and physical forces outside the control of the minds.  A large galactic event may annihilate the entire area that minds inhabit and end this grand experiment prematurely. Or if we are really unlucky, a plague on earth may end it in the next couple of decades.\nOn the location of Minds\nWhere is the mind?  Currently it is this mass of neurons in our heads.  There may exist in the future a way to augment this mind or even transfer this mind to a much more robust medium.  In fact, extremely long life may require this transfer take place many times over the course of the future.\nOn Atoms\nThe possibility of this transfer is due to the fact that, at their core, atoms of particular elements are fungible.  That is, one carbon atom is completely indistinguishable from another.  Further the molecules that these atoms form, when positioned in 3D space in a similar manner, act the same.  On a much more complex level, if I were able to take make a 3D scan of your brain at the atomic level and reassemble it with a 3D printer, it would be the same mind.  It would have your memories.  The axons in brain 1 that had been strengthened would be strengthened in brain 2.\nTo go to a further technological step, if I'm able to create a nano-device that simulates a neuron with fidelity and I'm able to arrange these simulated neurons in the same connections as your in your mind, this new mind would be the same mind.\nNow having two minds that think they are one mind cause a another set of issues, but let's not get ahead of ourselves.\nOn Immediate Hurdles\nThere are two immediate hurdles for humanity to get over to reach immortality and neither is unimaginable.\nThe first is that we need to put a cap on the genetic code that causes our cells to age.  Many scientists expect this process to be mostly figured out soon.  We have already discovered that telomere strings get shorter as cells divide and when they get short enough, cells stop regenerating.  By manipulating this string of genetic bits we may be able to drastically extend expected life spans.  A doubling of life spans at this point may be enough to get us to the life expectancy slope of 1 that we need to reach.\nThe second is that we need to diversify the space that we inhabit in the galaxy.  First to Mars, and then beyond.\nOn Macro-hurdles\nOnce these initial hurdles are achieved we will need to work on bigger problems like overcoming accidents.  Perhaps by 'backing up' our minds. Then on to active back ups.  Etc.\nOn the distant unseen\nThe further out we get on our technological development map, the harder it is to speculate about what may be possible. There are even strange things to contemplate when our technology gets advanced enough.  For example: \nWhat happens if we send our duplicated minds into different light cones?  Are they still the same mind?\nWhen we contemplate the heat death of the universe, is there a way to construct a zero-energy latices for the reconstitution of minds upon another 'big bang.'\nMany of these ideas sound crazy and far out, and truly they are, but these questions, and others like them cannot be addressed until we first solve the problem of preserving our minds far beyond what our current bodies allow.\n"},"a_definitions_of_toward.html":{"url":"a_definitions_of_toward.html","title":"A definition of 'toward'","keywords":"","body":"A definitions of 'toward'\nThere is nothing tricky in the way I am using 'toward' in my title of this book.  I believe there is an economics that can propel us toward a much, much longer lifespan for our minds.  This economics is not a magic bullet that can outstrip the laws of physics and the path from here to immortality being achieved maybe be a very, very long path. Also do not underestimate mankind's ability to aim poorly.\nOn the shape of the change in life expectancy\nWhat shape should we want to achieve in the change in life expectancy?  It turns out that the answer is 'a convex curve with a slope greater than one.'  This shape will help us reach a life expectancy that is for most practical cases 'immortal.'\nIf I am a 20 year old male in 2015 and my life expectancy is 80, and then a year later, in 2016, my life expectancy is 80.1, I have gained .1 years of life expectancy in a year.  The rate of change here is 1/10.  If that rate is constant we will end up with a life expectancy of 86 when we reach 80.  Six more years than we thought we'd get when we were 20! In fact, if we run the sim out to our expected death we see that we live an average of 86.7 years.\nThat is decent, but what if we were able to increase expectancy by 0.5 years per year?  Then our expectancy when we hit 80 is 110!  30 more years! But, we also see that if we run the sim to expected death we can expect to live to see 140.  Almost, twice what we thought we'd see when we were 20.\nWhen we run the simulation with a rate of change of 1.1 years per year we see that our lives no longer have an 'expectancy.'  When we reach this tech milestone, and can sustain it, we will have reached practical 'immortality.'\nWhen I say that this is an economics 'toward' immortality, this is what I am speaking of.  We need to accelerate the increase in life expectancy to as close to and/or beyond 1 per year as possible, and we need to do it as quickly as possible.  You would think that imminent death would be enough to mobilize 6 billion people to pursue this goal, but that is not the case. In this book I will put forward an economics that moves us toward that mobilization and make a case for the moral imperative to do so.\nThe code to run these calculations is included below.\nIn this example we will see how the life expectancy of an individual can improve during a lifetime.\nWe will also see how an increase in this rate of change can drastically change one's life expectancy.\nThis function contains our simulation up to 80 years old:\nrun_life_test = (changePerYear)=>\nStart with an expectancy of 80 years at 20 years old.\n  life_expectancy_at_20 = 80\n  new_life_expectancy = life_expectancy_at_20\nCycle through 60 years and improve the life expectancy by the changePerYear each year.\n  for year in [1..60]\n    new_life_expectancy =  new_life_expectancy + changePerYear\n  return new_life_expectancy\nThis function contains our simulation up to expected death or 9999 years old:\nrun_life_test2 = (changePerYear)=>\nStart with an expectancy of 80 years at 20 years old.\n  life_expectancy_at_20 = 80\n  new_life_expectancy = life_expectancy_at_20\n  age = 20\nCycle through until we are older than the life expectancy.\n  while age We will run our example with a 0.1 year increment per year.\nexample1 = run_life_test(0.1)\nexample1b = run_life_test2(0.1)\nWe will run our example with a 0.5 year increment per year.\nexample2 = run_life_test(0.5)\nexample2b = run_life_test2(0.5)\nWe will run our example with a 2 year increment per year.\nexample3 = run_life_test(1.1)\nexample3b = run_life_test2(1.1)\nOutput our results:\nconsole.log \"example1:\" + example1 + \" death: \" + example1b\nconsole.log \"example2:\" + example2 + \" death: \" + example2b\nconsole.log \"example3:\" + example3 + \" death: \" + example3b\n"},"a_definition_of_economics.html":{"url":"a_definition_of_economics.html","title":"A definition of Economics","keywords":"","body":"A definition of Economics\nThe study of economics is the study of the dynamics of value.  We are going to talk a lot about value and I have some very opinionated ideas about exactly what value is.  Regardless of your definition of value, Economics is the study of how that value affects the value of other things in society.  Traditionally this is money vs. goods/services.  I'm going to go deeper than this and look at value on many different levels and explore how we can use the patterns of the dynamics of value at lower levels of to point us in the direction of reaching immortality at higher levels.\nOn Money\nMoney is a tool.  We get to design tools.  The money of today is not the money of yesterday and won't be the money of tomorrow.  We will discuss this more, but now I'll simply ask you to set aside your availability bias of greenbacks and banks and the FED and realize that we could implement many different systems of money.\nOn Value\nRobert Pirsig would call it Quality.  Christopher Alexander would call it wholeness.  Eliezer Yudkowsky would call it...humanism?  Whatever 'it' is, it is value.  And we pay for value.  Other forces pay for value as well.  The actual currency involved in value exchange can vary greatly, but what the end goal of the exchange is does not vary.  It is more value.  We will see that this universe is ultimately involved in one goal, the development and expansion of value.\nAnother key factor of value is that it is all future value.  This will hold true until we find a way to overcome time itself.  That may happen, but until then, all the value that we will experience is in the future.  Past value has gone and cannot be reconstituted.  You can't 'store' it.  Well, you can, but only on certain levels and for certain purposes. It is complicated.  The thing to remember is that if anyone ever tells you that they have a way for you to 'preserve value for the future' they are probably selling you something. Don't trust them.\nOne can 'pump water uphill' or store energy in chemical form in a way that can be rapidly extracted, but even pure energy can fluctuate in value drastically under the right circumstances.  This is not to say that one shouldn't make 'good bets' on value.  It is often the only thing we can do.\nOn Greed\nI'm greedy.  I want to live forever.  I want to experience it all.

Our moral framework should answer this question.  People have sought to derive morality from ancient texts, from royal decree, and from moral philosophy.  This book assumes that morality emerges from the very metaphysics of our universe.  We can see what our moral framework should be by simply looking around us at what is.\nThis is not going to be enough for many people.  In a sense it is a presupposition that it is good and right for there to be this reality we live in and that we can derive what is good and right by observing what we see.\nOn the duality of morality\nWe will find by observing that there is a Moral Authority given to more advanced and complex entities.  This Moral Authority must always be balanced with a Moral Responsibility given from the more advanced and complex entities to lesser entities.  This is derived for the reality that any lesser entity may be a springboard to a new and more complex entity that has never existed before.\nOn Evil\nEvil arises in two ways.\nThe first is when the moral authority is threatened from below.\nThe second is when the moral responsibility is ignored or currently unachievable. This often manifests in a 'moral dilemma' that seemingly cannot be overcome without committing some evil.\nOn knowledge\nBut we are not left alone with this evil.  We can explain.  And we can codify our explanations so that we know.  Our minds are universal explainers.  And using the tools we have on hand, and the ones we will develop, we should be universal constructors.

His most popular work is called A Pattern Language and is commonly referenced as the inspiration for computing patterns in computer science.  In trying to figure this out, he has shown, via experiment, that there is a set patterns in physical structure that humans react to in the same way. When shown differing images of structure, humans have more agreement than disagreement about what structures have more 'life' in them.\nIn his Nature Of Order series he has laid out what these structures are and how one can develop them.  This system is based on the idea of 'centers' and the interactions of 'centers.' Each structure is made up of a set of centers and the value that each center contributes to the wholeness of the system is calculated by observing both the smaller centers that make up the center and the external centers that enhance the center.\nCenters are enhanced by any one of 15 properties:\n\nLevels of Scale\nStrong Centers\nThick Borders\nPositive Space\nAlternating Repetition\nGood Shape\nLocal Symmetry\nDeep Interlock and Ambiguity\nContrast\nGradients\nRoughness\nEchoes\nThe Void\nSimplicity and Inner-calm\nEach in the other\n\nEach of these characteristics has a corresponding life giving process that, if applied will increase the wholeness of the system.  By following the following process, one can improve a system:\nAlexander’s 10 structure-enhancing actions\n\nStep-by-step adaptation.\nEach step helping to enhance the whole.\nAlways making centers.\nAllowing steps to unfold in the most fitting order.\nCreating uniqueness everywhere.\nWorking to understand needs of users.\nEvoking & being guided by a deep feeling of whole.\nFinding coherent geometric order.\nEstablishing a form language that rises from & shapes thing being made.\nAlways striving for simplicity by which thing becomes more coherent & pure.\n\nIt turns out that integrating these 15 properties across higher order systems leads to a lot of things that make a whole lot of sense.  The following is an exercise that I did trying to integrate over the concept of banking:\n\nLevels of Scale -> Economic Organization\nStrong Centers -> Citizens Transactions\nBoundaries -> Separation of Accounts\nAlternating Repetition -> Money Life Cycle\nPositive Space -> Market Satisfaction\nGood Shape -> Fairness\nLocal Symmetries -> Transparency\nDeep Interlock and Ambiguity -> Transaction Dependency\nContrast -> Identity\nGradients -> Disbursement\nRoughness -> User Friendliness\nEchos -> Patterns\nThe Void -> Legal Entities\nSimplicity and Inner Calm -> Reliability\nNot Separateness -> Elegance\n\nLeslie Wauguespack expands on these ideas and applies them to software systems in Thriving System Theory and Metaphor Driven Modeling.  \nWholeness can be evaluated using the following properties:\n\nLevels of Scale -> Stepwise Refinement\nStrong Centers -> Cohesion\nBoundaries -> Encapsulation\nAlternating Repetition -> Extensibility\nPositive Space -> Modularization\nGood Shape -> Correctness\nLocal Symmetries -> Transparency\nDeep Interlock and Ambiguity -> Composition of Function\nContrast -> Identity\nGradients -> Scale\nRoughness -> User Friendliness\nEchos -> Patterns\nThe Void -> Programmability\nSimplicity and Inner Calm -> Reliability\nNot Separateness -> Elegance\n\nAfter reading Alexander's Nature of Order I have a deep conviction that he is hitting on something very, very valuable.  The ability to improve systems by recursive refinement with focused goals of strengthening centers can be a radical formulation of improving our world.\nI don't think Alexander gets it 100% correct and I think his focus on architecture is too limited in scope(but probably necessary to the formulation of the theory).  It has much broader applications.\nIf you are interested in learning more about Christopher Alexander, I would recommend the following:\nThe Nature of Order: An Essay on the Art of Building and the Nature of the Universe, Book 1 - The Phenomenon of Life (Center for Environmental Structure, Vol. 9) \nThe Process of Creating Life: Nature of Order, Book 2: An Essay on the Art of Building and the Nature of the Universe\nThe Nature of Order: An Essay on the Art of Building and the Nature of the Universe, Book 3 - A Vision of a Living World\nThe Nature of Order: An Essay on the Art of Building and the Nature of the Universe, Book 4 - The Luminous Ground\nA Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction (Center for Environmental Structure)\nThe Timeless Way of Building \nThe Battle for the Life and Beauty of the Earth: A Struggle Between Two World-Systems (Center for Environmental Structure)\nChristopher Alexander: The Search for a New Paradigm in Architecture \nEliezer Yudkowsky\nEliezer wrote a series of blog posts over the course of number of years that has been combined into a book called Rationality: From AI to Zombies. It is a great look at how to think rationally and how to think like a scientist.  He points out a number of things that I had not thought of before and approaches hard to understand topics with clear explanation.\nYudkowsky is a reductionist, a Bayesian, and he isn't going to cut you a bit of slack on your metaphysics.  If the map doesn't match the territory he is going to call bs on you.  He will force you to redraw your map.\nHe believes that it all is ultimately just quarks but he's not against good maps, in fact, he's all about good maps which is why, ultimately, I think He and Dr. Pirsig are going to have more in common that you would think.  I think this because at the end of the day, Yudkowsky is a raging humanist. If all there are is quarks and you are a humanist, you have to answer as to why.\nIf you like your rationality to be laid out in story form you can read his Harry Potter fan fiction (yes really) at http://hpmor.com/.\nRobert Pirsig\nRobert Pirsig is best know for Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance where he puts forth a theory that there is a driving force to our universe called Quality that originates and drives our perceptions of subjects and objects.  He expands on this in a follow up book called Lila that has the meat of what I'd like to talk about.  In Lila he goes deeper into creating a 'Metaphysics of Quality' and trades his Classic/Romantic split of ZMM for the Dynamic/Static distinction of Lila.\nHe puts forward the idea that our world is divided into 4 levels of static quality and that approaching the world from these four levels helps to alleviate and clarify many of the moral dilemmas that we face in our modern world.  The levels are:\n\nInorganic - matter\nBiological - anything with DNA\nSocietal - Human organizations that a scientific instrument can't detect\nIntellectual - The manipulation of symbols which have abstract meaning\n\nPirsig contends that each of these are built on the level before via a process of dynamic quality.  At each level some effects dynamic quality 'latch' and become static quality. Each level is dependent on the level before, but operates on a completely different value structure.  What is valuable at the inorganic level is a thing to be overcome at the next higher level(biological).  In fact most of the adaptations at the biological level have to do with holding back the inherent chaos that is present at the inorganic level.\nPirsig system of the levels gave me a nice structure to filter some of my ideas through.  I'm concerned the more that I study his philosophy that there is a disconnect from, and possibly even a denial of, reality.  Pirsig's ultimate conclusion seems to be that there is no territory, only maps.  Quality helps us build the maps, but in the end it is all in our heads.  I also feel that he missed a couple of nuances about the levels that I will clarify later.\nNassim Taleb\nTaleb's big idea is anti-fragility.  Glass is fragile.  When you mail a glass you put fragile on the outside so that the mail carrier will subject it to as little volatility as possible.  A rock is robust. If you mail the rock it isn't going to be much affected by a volatile transfer.  Anti-fragile is beyond robust. An anti-fragile thing will gain from volatility.  You want the mail carrier to play volleyball with the anti-fragile package.\nTaleb contends that there are all sorts of areas out there we can put ourselves in an anti-fragile position.\nI think that Taleb's understanding of risk and 'black swan' events leads him to make some backward facing conclusion.  His antifragile revelation turns a lot of these on their heads and I think that with this new approach, he can break out of some of his uber-conservative tendencies.  Not to say that his conclusions aren't right, only to say that there is an approach to these fragile systems that moves them towards anti-fragile.\nRead more from Taleb:\nAntifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder (Incerto)\nFooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets (Incerto)\nThe Black Swan\nAlexander vs. Pirsig\nAlexander puts forth the ideas of stepwise refinement toward wholeness.  I believe that these rules of development are the modes of operation of Pirsig's dynamic quality.  Pirsig's approach is one of letting any dynamic quality generate a static pattern of value.  In other words there are no guard rails to this dynamic quality.  Alexander puts on guard rails.  I don't know so much if it is the actual words that make up the 15 process that are 'really' there as much as it is that dynamic quality produces static ratchets most often in these 15 ways.\nTheory: If one looks at the wake of dynamic quality, one will most often find operations corresponding to one or a combination of many of the 15 processes.\nTest:  Compare dynamic to static latches across a number of domains and compare latches that fall under the 15 properties vs. other categories.\nAlexander vs. Yudkowsky\nYudkowsky comes down squarely on the side that the universe is completely hostile to us.  His big warning is that as we move toward an Artificial Intelligence, we must be very careful because it may decide that we are no longer needed and it could bring about the end of the human race.  I don't doubt that this is possible, but I think he misses the Luminous Ground that Alexander speaks of in the Nature of Order.  Now Yudkowsky would probably reject this seemingly silly concept out right.\nThe Luminous Ground is a concept that there is some 'other' that causes nature to work toward wholeness. To his credit Alexander spends hundreds of pages laying out empirical evidence that this is in fact the case.  Perhaps some of it is a sketch and it needs fleshing out, especially in areas outside of architecture, but to Alexander's credit the is exactly what he is calling for.\nIf Alexander is correct then we have less of a concern of rogue AI if the development of it follows a stepwise pathway that ensures that wholeness is increased.  A wholeness aware and wholeness preserving AI should preserve and augment humanity instead of destroying it.\nTo be fair Alexander does point out ways in which some parts of a wholeness may break themselves up in order to increase wholeness and it does take a bit of faith, and perhaps hubris, to say that human beings increase the wholness to an effect that an advanced AI would want to keep us around.\nPostulate: If we approach AI development from a stepwise refinement manner and attempt to preserve and build wholeness, we will find an easier path to friendly AI.\nTheory: Past stepwise refinement has been in the business of increasing wholeness and has typically not eliminated but enhanced existing culture and life.\nTest: Observer advances in stepwise refinement vs. large jumps. We should see more preservation in the former.  This give us confidence in one approach to future advancements vs. another (stepwise vs. broad jump)\nAlexander vs. Taleb\nTaleb's big concern is negative black swans that emerge out of the chaos of interrelated systems.  Alexander points to a number of ways in which this is evident, especially in architecture where a few like minded individuals looking for glory have driven 'good architecture' off a cliff and to a silly, anti-human place.\nI think they would mostly agree, but I think that Alexander can take a bit of the edge off of Taleb's hardline conservative stance.  Alexander's point is that not all changes are bad...the wholeness preserving and enhancing ones are good.  We want them.\nLet's take Taleb's argument against GMOs.  Of course generating a form of wheat in a lab that adds many many new characteristics at one time and releasing it on the world is a recipe for disaster.  But if we use stepwise refinement of the genome we can increase wholeness.  This is the exact business that natural selection has been in the business of for hundreds of millions of years.  Must we wait for wholeness to increase at a biological pace?  I'd argue that we do not need to if we understand the wholeness increasing process.  Of course it is hard and of course it takes longer to get to all the good things we want.  But, if we want a wheat that is resistant to disease and produces 10x per acre, we have to move forward at a faster than biological pace.\nPostulate:  Develop GMO techniques that follow stepwise refinement.\nPirsig vs. Taleb\nI think Pirsig and Taleb would get along swimmingly.  Taleb's Antifragile is Pirsig's dynamic quality.  In the same way that I think that Taleb cold lose some of his conservative nature from Alexander, I think Prisig would help as well.  Pirsig's latch adds an element to Taleb's antifragile.  This latch could lead to massive change very quickly by amplifying the effect.  If we have huge upside via antifragility, and that upside occurs via a positive black swan and then this is amplified by another antifragile situation we can have rapidly moving advancement.  In fact I'll argue that Pirsig's levels derive from exactly these kinds of amplifications.  I'll refer to these amplified antifragile situations that latch as bootstraps.  They move so far that they appear to follow completely different sets of rules that the system that they emerged from.\nThe problem with these huge moves is that Taleb would dismiss them as fiddling with too much and opening us up to many more negative black swans.  In a sense he's right, a comet colliding with earth would wipe out quite a bit of amplification, but would we want that amplification to not exist?\nPostulate: We need to put ourselves in the position to take advantage of antifragile situations in such a way that they are amplified to the point of enhancing the wholeness of our reality. This manifests itself in the generation of a new kind of biology, a new form of biological system that enhances our well being, an amplification of our society, and/or an amplification of intelligence.\nPirsig vs Yudkowsky\nI'd love to see this debate.  Yudkowsky is a materialist and a reductionist.  Prisig says it all starts with quality and that the fact that we have an idea in our head of a quark is just a splitting of quality into subject and object.\nAt the end though they are both about maps and territories.  Yudkowsky says the map must match the material territory.  Pirsig says that maps are generated by quality and thus match the territory.  To-matos/Tom-atos?\nI think so.  If anything, I think that Yudkowsky's humanism betrays his material/reductionist stance.\nYudkowsky vs. Taleb\nI think these guys have reached many of the same conclusions about being careful when developing future tech, but they approach the world in two very different ways.  Yudkowsky is a futurist and is aching to bring it to fruition and Taleb is fine with the way things were 1000 years ago(plus a little bit of medicine).\nOther Authors Who's Ideas Color This Work\nFrancis Fukuyama\nThe Origins of Political Order: From Prehuman Times to the French Revolution\nPolitical Order and Political Decay: From the Industrial Revolution to the Globalization of Democracy\nFukuyama points out the importance of our political institutions  Much of my proposed political structure is derived from these ideas.\nDavid Deutsch\nThe Beginning of Infinity: Explanations That Transform the World\nDeutsch's has contributed quite a bit to my thinking of how we move the intellectual layer forward and has some great ideas round knowledge and evil.\nPeter M.

How did we get from there to here?  I call this the bootstrap and there are a number of phases that our universe has gone through to put humans on this planet at this time in history.  We are going to look at each level and explore how it led to the the higher level system emerging.\n"},"the_bootstrap/the_inorganic_to_the_biological.html":{"url":"the_bootstrap/the_inorganic_to_the_biological.html","title":"The inorganic to the biological","keywords":"","body":"The inorganic to the biological\nThe inorganic can be subdivided into three levels:\n\nSub-Atomic\nAtomic\nMolecular\n\nI am not going to speak much about the subatomic level as I currently have only a vague understanding of exactly what is going on at that level.  The current major questions that we should observe at the subatomic level is the question between a collapsing quantum reality or a reality that has branching universes. My speculative inclination is to think that we will find reality emerging out of infinite randomness.\nThe thing about the subatomic level that we have observed that is really important is how it supports the atomic level and what it tells us about that level.  Ultimately we find the very important fact that an atom of one element is fundamentally the same as another element of the same type under the same forces.  An atom of oxygen on earth, and an atom of oxygen on Mars will react in the same way to the local forces if swapped.  Now of course the forces present on Mars and Earth are very different, but the reaction of that molecule can be predicted and will be consistent.\nBecause these molecules are consistent, they behave reliably.  The reliable behavior that we see is the grouping of atoms into molecules. \nThe fact that this behavior happens, and happens reliably, is at the core of most of our 'hard' sciences.  If you heat water at -2 degrees C to 10 degrees C, it behaves in a very predictable way and a scientist on the other side of the planet can reproduce the same experiment and see the same results.\nFortunately for us, atoms did not stick to just forming a finite set of molecules.  One particular atam, Carbon, has properties that allow it to make many different formations.  These formations are so dynamic and have such emergent properties that we call them 'organic.'  Organic chemistry is the study of carbon based molecules that are often made up of tens, hundred, or even, in the case of DNA, millions of atoms.  The behavior of organic molecules are much, much more diverse than standard molecules and much harder to predict.\nThis step up from the standard molecules to massively complex molecules is what we call a bootstrap.  We will ultimately see the bootstrap at many different levels of reality and ultimately we will base much of our theories on a conclusion that the universe is ultimately in the business of bootstraps.\nThis inorganic bootstrap takes us from a very predictable set of behaviors in basic molecules to advanced organic molecules that we begin to see as biological system.  These biological systems are able to reproduce themselves and diversify themselves.  While the methods that biological systems use to reproduce and diversify themselves are built on the underlying interactions of forces at the inorganic level, they ultimately overcome those forces and interact at a level that is independent of the organic level.\nThere is a fairly thin line here that must be observed. It is probably a bit heretical in scientific circles to say that the biological has no dependency on the inorganic, but that is exactly what I mean to say.  Of course the inorganic still has a causal relationship with the biological and the biological is built on the inorganic, but I'm specifically talking, in terms of economics and value here.  Biological basis of value is completely different that the basis of value in inorganic things.\nIt is typical here to be very hesitant to think about an inorganic molecule 'wanting' or 'valuing' something.  It even seems unrealistic to think of small biological systems like bacteria 'valuing' or 'wanting.' I don't mean to over anthropomorphize here and I invite you to try to take as much of the humanness out of those words as possible.  We are simply talking about what is exchanged and used in each of those systems to move the system forward.\nLet us take a step back and consider the inorganic and try to define an economics of that level of organization.\nYou can consult with your local University chemistry professor to get all the hairy details, but what we find at the center of value in the inorganic realm is a set of forces.  This manifests itself in the form of orbiting electrons.  The supply and demand curves at this level are remarkably simple.  Molecules want their outermost shell of electrons to be full. An oxygen molecule needs two extra electrons to have its outer shell full.  It turns out that hydrogen has one electron so two of them together can complete oxygen's outer shell, and all of a sudden we have a new entity called H2O that exerts its own unique set of forces on the universe.\nIn the 'hard' atoms we see some rumblings of the life creating structure and processes, but it is not until we get to carbon that the the whole array begins to shine and we head toward our bootstrap condition.\nChris Alexander introduces his 15 life structures and associated life creating processes in his Nature of Order. They are:\n\nLevels of Scale\nStrong Centers\nThick Boundaries\nAlternating Repetition\nPositive Space\nGood Shape\nLocal Symmetry\nDeep interlock and ambiguity\nContrast\nGradients\nRoughness\nEchos\nThe Void\nSimplicity and inner calm\nEach in the other\n\nCarbon allows such a myriad of different combinations (including itself) that it can exhibit all of these characteristics and achieve the bootstrap to biological reality. We will refer to this organization as 'patterned forces.'  If you prefer to think in the frame of the classic / romantic split, the forces are romantic, and the patterned forces are the classic.  You need both working together to achieve the bootstrap.\nWe will return to this list of characteristics and processes at each level as the seem to be at the core of what consider to be 'life'.  They are a common red thread woven through a tapestry of very different fabrics.\nWhat we are left with at the top of the bootstrap is a new biological system.  The value at this level of reality is very different than at the inorganic level.  In fact, we see that most of the functionality we see at this level is centered around overcoming the forces that were valued at the lower level.\nAt the biological level we meet fitness. Reproduction and survival are valued above all else.  Evolution wants to spread genes as far and as wide as it can.  The inorganic bootstrap culminated in a molecule that is able to reproduce itself and spread across its environment.\nThe biological level is above the inorganic.  As a result, it has access to the inorganic level even if it has a different value structure.  In fact inorganic material is often the major tool of biological systems.  Biological systems have adapted to create structure out of inorganic material in a way that increases the biological system's ability to further overcome the inorganic forces.\nWhat we end up with is the biological level operating on two different and distinct economies. We find it trying to achieve two different and distinct bootstraps.  First we will address Biology dealing with the inorganic level.\n"},"the_bootstrap/the_biological_to_the_societal.html":{"url":"the_bootstrap/the_biological_to_the_societal.html","title":"The biological to the societal","keywords":"","body":"The biological to the societal\nWe have established that the inorganic bootstrapped to the biological level.  At the biological level, fitness is valued.  At this level a system survives only as well as it is able to reproduce.  Because biology is at a higher level than the inorganic level it has access to utilize the systems at that level for its own purposes.\nWe find at the biological level an economy of environment that is used to increase reproduction.  This can be seen in amoeba surviving in wet swampy places and desert lizards needing to be...well...in the desert.\nEach of these biological systems survived because existing in the correct environment increase the likelihood that the builder's DNA would survive another generation.\nThe natural flow here from base economy to bootstrap is the flow from environment to controlled environment.  We see this in the creation of structure by biological systems\nThis may start as simply as the membrane constructed around an amoeba to protect the survival of its DNA or may be as complicated as the structure of an ant bed to survive a rain storm. Ultimately we see biology overcoming environment with structure.\nHow does it make this transition from overcoming environment to creating it?  It uses its value infrastructure: reproduction.\nUnfortunately evolution is a blind, mad god.  Often its adaptations lead nowhere.  Millions of years are wasted here and million there.  A comet comes along and wipes out a few hundred thousand lines of development.\nUltimately though, we end up with biological systems developing the ability to create an system that exists beyond the biological-inorganic.  We call this this level 'societal.'  It is social.  It is a structure that exists only in a mind.  Some of these minds in nature are very primitive and some, as with humans, are very very advanced.  The bootstrap here is from structure to society.  Once we get to society we again see a transfer away from the value at the lower level to a new value structure.  In a sense a new economy.  This economy may look much more familiar to you.  The value at the society level is one of resources.\nI'll first speak about primitive societies and then extend that to more advanced societies.  Let's take a hive of Bees.  The bees clearly have the reproduction down and form a society around the collection of pollen and production of honey.  The shape of this society is governed by the amount of resources the colony is able to collect.  If resources are scarce fewer drones are needed.  As soon as supply increases, drone population returns to normal.  This is basic supply and demand operating at this societal level.\nWhen we see this operating in an 'advanced society' we see the emergence of modern markets based on complex tools that we call 'money'.  The dynamic side of this level is the procurement and use of resources.  Static patterns of value emerge out of this through development into a sophisticated market with cash and cash equivalents at the center. The concepts at the society level are much easier to relate to because we live them everyday.  Our world is saturated with society.  Everything around us from government, to educational institutions to the family unit revolves around our ability to procure the resources we need to keep our society relevant.  It may be distasteful to think about family being a function of the resources that that unit can bring to bear, but that is the reality of societal life.  Our modern life has be amplified by the tool of money.  Money allows us to drastically simplify the exchange of a held resource for a desired resource.  This tool of money is ultimately what the bootstrap of society to supersociety will be based on. Much more on that later.\nThe economics of society are well known and can be found in many modern economic text books.  Supply. Demand. Utility. Separation of labor.  The god of society is the market and the market is much more reasonable than the blind god of evolution. Unfortunately, this god's appetite is voracious.  I call the market a blind raptor.  The market doesn't see that its consumption will drain and destroy the water supply...it just senses the heat and consumes.  It is a dynamic system and despite the fact that it consumes without prejudice, it also happens to work really, really well.\nIt especially works really well when all the resources are hard goods.  When we run out of chickens, chickens get really really valuable and are consumed less.  When we bootstrap up to money though, we get to a dangerous territory where financial engineering can cause recursive breakouts that consume all the way to the bone.\nThe societal jump from the simple interplay of resources to a money society is a huge jump.  In fact we will look at a chart later and it will have more developments between one and the other of any other item on the chart.\nTo get to money we pass through a number of other systems that emerge on the societal level.  Remember, while the biological had the inorganic to play with, societal systems have both inorganic and biological systems to utilize and create economies around.\nFirst let's talk about how society creates an economy around the biological.  Since societal is closest to biological in the evolution, this is where society start creating economies.  Human society deals with biology on a moment to moment to bases.  Even when we sleep and are ignorant of the inorganic surrounds around us, we still breathe.\nSociety builds on the biological and creates an economy of belonging.  This starts by creating groups that can operate together to facilitate the collection of resources and dole them out in an appropriate manner.\nSomething interesting happens almost immediately to this grouping.  Conflict.  When our classic conflict occurs we get our incredibly romantic solution of breaking the group apart and creating diversity.  This grouping/diversity split is what helped mankind fill the earth.  It can also get pretty nasty and erupt in violence once the ability to split away becomes more onerous than violence to maintain one's position.  Despite this, we've managed to create quite an array of cultures across our planet.\nOne of the ways these diverse groups have managed to separate themselves is via the way we interact, form and deal with the inorganic.  We call this art and architecture.  It is an outgrowth of the way biology formed the inorganic to into environments and structure.  We see this manifest itself in the way we structure our environments(architecture) and the way we fill those spaces(art).  The economy here is one of wholeness.  How does the societal mind see the art and the space.  Does it create a sense of life in the mind?  Because this level is so basic and since societies are so good at marshaling resources to create bad architecture and bad art, we see an immense amount of waste here.  The economy here is very inefficient.  But one still exists.\nThis system of society is dynamic enough to lead to a massive biodiversity on earth and culture in our human society.  Fortunately for us, the mad blind god didn't just stop with a mind for society, it also created another kind of mind, one that we call intelligence.\n"},"the_bootstrap/the_biological_to_intellegence.html":{"url":"the_bootstrap/the_biological_to_intellegence.html","title":"The biological to intellegence","keywords":"","body":"The biological to intelligence\nThe inorganic is restrained to dealing in forces and as a result, we observe a number of different phenomena. One of these is the organization into organic compounds that bootstrap to life.  There are of course other bootstraps that have occurred and we can see them around us in the solar system and out in our galaxy.  The sun, the planets, black holes, etc are all phenomena that result from the interplay of forces in the inorganic world.\nIn the same way that the inorganic can bootstrap in many different ways, so can the biological.  The case that we are speaking of here specifically is that biology bootstrapped another kind of mind that was not just societal in nature. This mind does not just deal in the trading off of resources.  It is above that.  This mind deals in a very different resource that has always been present nature, but has generally been ignored by the other economies that we have discussed.  This mind is called intellect and the stuff at the core of its economics is time.\nYou may consider it an odd thing to say that time has no value at the inorganic, biological, and societal levels, but this is the reality.  Time is present at those levels, but it isn't until the human mind that we see a bootstrap to a level where a system can deal in time and recall back to a previous state of nature and use that previous state to affect the future.\nThe inorganic is subject to natural law, biology to the mad blind god of evolution, society to the blind raptor god of the market, but with intellect, we achieve rationality and that changes everything.  We can observe the past and project events into the future.  This ability is not perfect at all levels, but it is good enough to be superior to society.  We often call this bootstrapped level of time use 'science.'  The ability to observe the past and use those observations in a way that affect the future will help us bootstrap to a super-intelligence.  But we aren't there yet.  Getting there is what this book is about.\nJust like the societal systems, the intellectual system has access to the levels below it.  It is a bit unique in that it has access to a level, society, that it wasn't built on.\nLet look at each level starting with society. What is the economic system at work on intellectual - societal level?  It is an economic system based on culture at the outset and culminates in diversity as quality culture is pursued.  We see this level manifest itself in the study of the arts and many of the social sciences.  We observe cultures, see how the development plays out, and then attempt to explain how and when similar patterns may emerge in the future.  Are these patterns of quality?\nAt the intellectual - biological level we find the life sciences and in particular the study of human biology. The currency here is that of self preservation. When we reach quality at this level, we finally find the immortality that I speak of in the title of this book. Much of the remainder of this book will seek to determine how we can steer and manipulate the economic system to reach this level of quality so that our existing minds will continue to exist far into the future.\nAt the intellectual - inorganic level we find the replayability of inorganic manipulations...in other words machines. When we pursue these machines to a level of quality we produce industry. These are our engineering sciences. Increasing the quality at this level will help us get to immortality as well as many of these machines help us self preserve at the biological level.\nWe find ourselves, in our modern world, with a brain that has two minds inside of it. System One processes things in frame without time. It is instant and reactionary. It colors all we see and what we see is all there is. System Two is a mind that understands and uses time to its advantage. Currently, System Two does a very poor job of not being influenced by System One because it developed with that system in place. Many of the arguments we get in about what our modern life should look like are based on the fact that we don't think much about the fact that these two minds have two very different economic models. In fact, between society and the intellect we have 7 different economies all interacting and crossing over. Perhaps by separating them out and creating a framework for thinking about them from a moral perspective we can begin to find a path to the place in the future where we all want to be.\n"},"the_morality_of_the_bootstrap/the_bootstrap_order.html":{"url":"the_morality_of_the_bootstrap/the_bootstrap_order.html","title":"The bootstrap order","keywords":"","body":"The bootstrap order\nNow that we have looked at each level, let's summarize how the bootstrap occurred and create a systematized layout of what our system looks like.\n\n\n\n\nInorganic (1)\nBiological (4)\nSocietal (9)\nIntellectual (13)\n\n\n\n\nIntellectual\n-\n-\n-\ntime observation (14) / science - replayability (24)\n\n\nSocietal\n-\n-\nresources (10) / money (20)\nculture (17) / diversity(23)\n\n\nBiological\n-\nfitness (5) / biodiversity (8)\ngrouping (11) / disbursement (12)\nself preservation (15) / health(22)\n\n\nInorganic\nforces(2) / patterned forces(3)\nenvironment (6) / structure (7)\nobject creation (16) / art (19)\nmachinery (18) / industry(21)\n\n\n\nThe Inorganic(1) values Forces(2). Quality forces emerged in the form of patterned forces(3) that bootstrapped to the Biological(4).  The biological used a different value system based on fitness(5).  The biological began to seek environment(6) and realized that it could manipulate environment into a quality environment via structure(7).  The diffusion of biological life to various environments and the ability to create multiple different structures led to the valuing of many different kinds of fitness that we call bio-diversity(8).\nThis biodiversity eventually found a bootstrap via survival of the fittest to society(9).  This occurred because organisms stumbled into an environment where working together allowed genes to survive from generation to generation.  These new societies valued resources(10) that they needed to maintain their organization.  Because resources were limited societies began to group(11).  As these groups sought more and more quality groupings they developed disbursement(12).  And the world was filled.\nAlong the way a second bootstrap from biology occurred when biology discovered that observing what happened over the course of time was a quality way to gain fitness.  Intelligence(13) emerged.  This system valued time observation(14) and enabled entities to understand the concept of self preservation(15).  The ability to observe change over time enabled some animals to not just manipulate the environment via patterned forces as had existed in structure, but now they could create objects(16) based on repeating and rearranged observable forces.  These objects led to culture(17) in humans(who had the most advanced brains) as humans sought to pass this knowledge on from one generation to the next(see work and thought on memes). Some humans realized they could leverage inorganic material to create some of these cultural items and machinery(18) was born.  Machinery allowed some humans to pursue created objects that have a quality beyond utility and we call these items art(19).  The proliferation of goods causes humans to seek a quality exchange of goods that resulted in the creation of cash money(20) based markets.  Increased access to capital allowed us to pursue quality machinery resulting in industry(21).  Industry freed us to pursue a quality self preservation resulting in increased healthiness(22).  The ability for all people to have a healthy existence enabled us to envision multiple societies thriving.  This enables diversity(23).  Finally, a generally peaceful and healthy planet frees us to pursue quality time observation...aka science(24).\nThe order that items appear here is important and reveal quite a bit about the development of morality and value over time.  First let's take each pair and look at the value authority that is present in each.\npatterned forces > (greater value authority) forces - an ordered universe...literally the fact that the seat you are sitting on doesn't drop you onto the floor relies on the fact that patterned forces can suppress unpatterned forces, or chaos.\nstructure > environment - structure creates and gives form to environment.\nbiodiversity > reproduction - the definition of survival of the fittest.  If you are more fit, you reproduce.  A biodiverse planet has more antifragility than a planet with just one species.\nart > object creation - we value art more than general objects.  We really value beautiful things that are also useful.\ndisbursement > grouping - we don't all live in the same place for a reason.  It is a much more quality use of resources to spread out.\nmoney > resources - Economists might refer to this as the liquidity premium.  Money has more value than resources because it can be exchanged for anything else more easily.\nindustry > machinery - Collusion, cooperation, vertical integration.  Call it what you want, but machines working together and in line produce more in less time.\nhealth > self preservation - Self preservation allows you to live a long life but subject to inorganic and biological forces, health allows us to suppress those forces and live even longer\ndiversity > culture - your culture cannot suppress the diversity of others.  Call it political correctness if you like but I like to think of it as not being a jerk.\nscience > time observation - can you replay it?  If so it has more reliability and more value than if you observed a one time occurrence.\nWe don't just learn about value authority, we also learn something about moral authority.  Each system level has moral authority over the one before it.  We don't bat an eye when biological systems suppress and manipulate inorganic system.  For thousands of years human society didn't seem to bat an eye when a societal edict manipulated biology.  From the king's forest to capital punishment, we are only recently making some concessions that maybe we shouldn't give society free reign over biology...and that comes from our intellectual system observing the poor effects of some of our biological manipulations.  We are just now entering a time where we can reliably make intellectual edicts on the societal layer and many of these result in violent reactions from the societal layer.  This makes sense: of course those that still operate mostly on the societal plane of existence don't want to be subject to an intellectual layer that they hardly understand, but, it is morally right that they make way.  The intellectual has overcome the societal and is more advanced.\nIdeally the  intellectual should and can find a solution that least disrupts the levels below. That is the quality thing to do.  It is also the wise thing to do because the intellectual hasn't overcome the last obstacle in this universe and it is likely that another bootstrap even more advanced is around the corner.  If intellectuals want to be respected in the future by system next, they need to show, with scientific replayability, that the balance between this authority and responsibility is the quality way forward.\n"},"the_bootstrap/what_comes_next.html":{"url":"the_bootstrap/what_comes_next.html","title":"What comes next?","keywords":"","body":"What comes next?\nSo what comes next?  How do we pursue what comes next?  Should we pursue what comes next?\nThere are a lot of questions here and very few answers.  Let's look at each possibility and see if we can find examples of a bootstrap already occurring.\nInorganic -> Biology II\nBiology -> System III\nSociety -> Supersociety\nIntelligence -> Superintelligence\nWhat we find is that predicting the next bootstrap is much more complicated that first considered because we now have four different frames through which to achieve it.\nInorganic -> Biology II\nThe first scenario to consider is that the inorganic is not finished bootstrapping at all. The biological was an impressive leveraging of patterned forces to an entire new system, but perhaps the carbon based bootstrap is just the first and most likely pattern to emerge as a coherent system.\nIn fact it is likely that if we spend enough time looking and changing our frame of reference we will find all sorts of bootstraps that have occurred because of patterned forces.\nThe forming, expanding, and dying of galaxies may be at one end of the time and distance scale where we see emergence of entities, with diversity and interaction.\nOn a much smaller scale, science is uncovering a number of inorganic patterns that can be manipulated to produce unique behavior. It is likely that the conditions for some of these patterns to sustain themselves may take an intelligence to produce.\nConsider for example, an set of inorganically based neurons that have produce an intelligence that can sustain itself and spread itself. From what we know about electricity and the forces involved, it is possible that this kind of bootstrap has already occurred 'somewhere' out in the universe. Many AI researchers are actively trying to pursue this kind of bootstrap.\nThe key thing to consider here is what would identify something as a unique Biology II instead of just another branch of our current biological bootstrap. The answer is that the underlying economics of this Biology II would not use reproduction as the basis of its new economics.\nThis is a very hard thing to even imagine, but let’s try. Consider something like 'the borg' in Star Trek. Now this example has a bit of intelligence mixed in(otherwise it wouldn't be a very good story), but let’s pretend that the borg didn't have an evil intelligence at its center, but instead just operated on the basis of 'assimilation'. This system seeks to draw resources to itself and grow.\nLike I said, the examples are hard, but there may be some merit in looking at general, base elements and considering, 'what system do I want to be at work here' and then arranging the elements in such a way that the elements pursue that agenda. The bootstrap is what emerges out of that we don't expect.\nYou can see the areas of personalized medicine and nanotechnology here. You can also see the underlying threats of things like the gray goo scenario.\nIn the end we still have the economics of patterned forces at the inorganic level, but we are looking for ways in which those forces emerge to pursue something other than 'survival of the fittest.'\nBiology to System III\nTo date, biology has spawned two different bootstraps, the society bootstrap and the intelligence bootstrap. What can we consider and say about a possible third system that could emerge out of biology?\nWe have two systems, one that values resource allocation, and one that values the observation of time. Do we just start picking out other things that exist and doing thought experiments?\nLet's take something like 'physical connection'. In this thought experiment, our biological system begins to value having as many connections with other entities as possible. Consider a being that, when it encounters another being, can read its DNA and assimilate that DNA into its own. So in this system, to maximize the spread of your DNA you have to physically inhabit the same physical space as as many other beings as possible and then diversify out into the universe as far away from many of those entities as possible to ensure that you don't fall prey to some galactic event that wipes out all beings that you've connected with. In this pattern I can see a number of very valuable patterns emerging around very fast space travel and communications. What becomes important? Finding other entities, getting there, and then spreading out.\nWe see postulation about biological entities by people like Freeman Dyson that proposed a type of animal that is evolved for interstellar travel.\nIt is unlikely that anything on that scale is going to directly impact us here on earth though. What is much more likely with our current tech are genetic engineering issues that lead to odd and potentially horrifying things that we see in fiction like predators being specifically designed for war or chimeric efforts like the island of Dr. Moreau.\nIn the end, it is the economics of biodiversity that must produce a system that revolves around something other than grouping or time observation. We also have the added component that the bootstrap must be 'up'. Biology has bootstrapped a number of extraordinary systems in the inorganic space. We talk about these as structure and environment. But these systems are not 'above' the biological and are based on a known area of operations. This becomes much more important at the next two levels where we have a much richer area of 'known' areas to develop new systems in.\nSociety to Supersociety\nSociety allocates resources and has produced, at the top of its evolution, the use of cash money economics to allocate things efficiently. This gets much more difficult because our world is filled with things that are based on the pursuit and allocation of cash/resources that operate at lower levels. Culture(and the governments that it spawns) and art are produced at these 'known' levels. We have difficulty speculating about what kind of system the pursuit of resources could produce that is 'beyond' the known areas.  Arranging a universe in a way that accelerates the collection of knowledge needed to figure this out is at the heart of this book.\nIt is the core tenet of this book that by reforming and targeting the way our money works, that we can enable this next bootstrap. What will occur, I think, is that the reconfiguration of our pursuit of cash will develop exponentially and produce institutions that transcend our 'known' areas. Big dreams, but we have to start somewhere.\nIntelligence to Superintelligence\nThis one is fairly straight forward, but may not play out the way many expect. This bootstrap isn't just faster intelligence. Faster intelligence gets us there faster because the bootstrap builds on top of the underlying structure of science. But what will the superintelligence be? What systems will emerge when science is so basic to a thing that a systems is being built around it?\n"},"the_econimics_of_the_bootstrap/":{"url":"the_econimics_of_the_bootstrap/","title":"The economics of the bootstrap","keywords":"","body":"The economics of the bootstrap\nWe have an immense amount of information of how economics work in the areas of financial markets. I'm going to do my best to map these back to more basic bootstraps and show that the dynamics are similar and ultimately the effects of these economies manifest themselves in similar ways.\nThe foundations of most economic theories are built on the ideas of 'labor specialization' and 'supply and demand.'\nWe see these same patterns at work in at the inorganic level when we look at the supply and demand of forces. These forces supply and demand these forces in consistent ways. These consistencies lead to patterned forces and ultimately carbon emerges as a molecule that can form highly specialized patterns that can be reliably reproduced. At this level we see the economics of supply and demand and the benefit of specialized 'labor'.\nAs we move to biology, we see an economy emerge that deals in reproduction. Biology began to leverage the inorganic to form reliable environments and these environments each encouraged a different form of survival and reproduction. The massive proliferation of environments and discovered advantageous adaptations has lead to significant biodiversity. Through sheer brute force biology bootstrapped society and intelligence. Again we see the supply of and demand of reproducibility offered by DNA leading to the version of specialized 'labor' called biodiversity.\nAt the level of society it is resources that are supplied and demanded. Different sets of supplied resources lead to very different societies. So what should we be looking for if society is going to bootstrap to a supersociety? It certainly isn't a mono-culture. We need as many diverse societies as we can muster until we find the type of society that bootstraps. If this pattern follows the previous bootstraps we will have a large diversity of cultures all containing and preserving robust sub-groups with vibrant arts. These societies will be moving away from each other(as in out from earth and out into the galaxy.) When we do find the bootstrap, we need to be careful because it will likely be so dominant that the results of that culture will look at other cultures the same way we look at the societies that form among the lesser species of nature.\nOn the intelligence level we are dealing in the supply and demand of time. Intelligence operates on understanding the supply of time and demanding more of it. This ultimately culminates in science delivering massive improvements in time availability and the promise of more time leads to more science. The superintelligence bootstrap likely emerges from the diversification and amassing of reliable time observations and the ability to act on 'many many many' of them at one time. System 1 of our brains is pretty bad at operating on more than a couple observations at a time and System 2 ups that by letting us add in some processes that can build some complex systems, but it is likely that the superintelligence is going to be operating on thousands and thousands of simultaneous observations.\nIt is tempting to dismiss the possibilities of a Biology II or System III bootstrap but recent advances in nano-tech and genetic engineering put this back in play. For biology II we should look to processes that generate reliable and consistent systems that are not carbon based. This could lead to very different patterns than what carbon provides. For System III we can look toward the future possibility of engineering new variants of species on a drastically reduced timescale. If we are able to do these while also avoiding a grey goo scenario or a bio-accident of global proportions we might see another kind of bootstrap, but I expect these would look very alien to us.\n"},"the_bootstrap/a-moral-framework.html":{"url":"the_bootstrap/a-moral-framework.html","title":"A Moral Framework","keywords":"","body":"A Moral Framework\nSomething interesting starts to happen when you have two systems working with and against each other. You could say you have a fight over the rights of each system. We can call this a moral dilemma. Who wins? I believe that the system that develops out of another system has the right to have control over the lower system. We call this moral authority. This right is always paired with a needed set of things that system should and should not do. We call this moral responsibility. Do unto the other economies as you would want done unto yours.\nWe will explore this framework in the next few sections.\n"},"the_morality_of_the_bootstrap/the_distructive_valley.html":{"url":"the_morality_of_the_bootstrap/the_distructive_valley.html","title":"The destructive valley","keywords":"","body":"The destructive valley\nMorality is a dicey subject. It is so easy to use morality to oppress that I'm fairly hesitant to use the word. This chapter is very important because we are going to use the word morality but we must also be cautious of what I call the destructive valley. The destructive valley is when agents in one area, that have moral authority over a lower system, act without moral responsibility.\nWe can see some of the most obvious examples of this by looking at the socio-political happenings of the 20th century. After the amazing gains that science gave us during the industrial revolution, a number of political movements emerged that tried to leverage the moral authority of intellect over society to try to generate forms of 'utopia.' Again, it is hard to suggest that movements such as marxism and nazism had 'moral authority' over society, and yet they did. What they lacked, and why they were ultimately rejected is that they lacked moral responsibility. How did they lack responsibility? They were ultimately destructive to the layers below them in the moral cascade that they had authority over.\nWhat typically happens is that after a bootstrap reaches a certain point it becomes 'self aware' and realizes its power and authority over the lower levels. Unfortunately the next phase is for those agents to use the lower levels 'at all costs.' And sometimes the costs are very high indeed.\nMy hope is that we can highlight this tendency to have a destructive valley and plan for it. Even, perhaps, put a morality in place that insists on responsibility as opposed to just authority.\nMoral Responsibility > Moral Authority\nSo what is responsibility in this case? An agent with moral responsibility will understand its moral authority over lower cascade levels, and yet still make decisions that preserve and amplify wholeness at lower levels. The enlightenment has given us a secret weapon in this balancing act.  We must realize that our inability to balance can always be overcome with the right knowledge.  We never have to resort to destructive authority unless we are out of time and total annihilation is at stake.\nA practical example is that the intellect has authority over the inorganic, and we could certainly make short term gains by stripping the valuable resources from our environment, but, if we are morally responsible, we will use the resource in renewable and responsible ways. Here we can arrange environmentalism in our framework as not being forced on us by any authority, but demanded of us as a moral responsibility.\nAs we speak about future bootstraps, beware the destructive valley.\nViolence\nIn case it is not clear, the demands of moral responsibility override moral authority’s license to do violence to those in an inferior position. This applies in almost all but the most inescapable situations.\nViolence is mostly restricted to situations where morally inferior systems are deliberately attempting to undermine and destroy morally superior systems.\nOne such situation would be a nationalistic government declaring war on an intellectually grounded civilization. In such a case, violent retaliation is warranted if the intellectual society has exhausted non-violent recourse or is in imminent danger of destruction.\n"},"the_bootstrap/moral-grid.html":{"url":"the_bootstrap/moral-grid.html","title":"Moral grid","keywords":"","body":"The Moral Grid\nThe following chart lays out the current spectrum of political ideologies.  We can see how each ideology holds up to our ideal of recognizing the authority of the intellect over society, but also approaches society with a permissive responsibility.\nWe find the most ideal state to be that of the progressive.  This parallels our ideal of stepwise refinement and genuinely reflects the ideals of the enlightenment.\nOf course to those on the far left, progressivism will seem far too conservative, but hopefully, our new framework of bootstraps will reign in those that would charge wildly into the future with no concern for the present wholeness.\n\n\n\n\nDescription\nCultural Authority\nIntellectual Authority\nCultural Responsibility (Diversity)\nIntellectual Responsibility (Science)\n\n\n\n\nAlt Right\ngives culture authority over intellectualism and emphasizes a responsibility to overthrow intellectualism\nfor\nagainst\nagainst\nneutral\n\n\nReligious Right\ngives culture authority over intellectualism because Jesus\nfor\nagainst\nagainst\nagainst\n\n\nNeo Con\nseeks dominance of culture via intellectual means\nfor\nagainst\nfor\nfor\n\n\nConservative\nseeks cultural and intellectual parity in the realm of authority and ignores responsibility\nfor\nneutral\nfor\nfor\n\n\nLiberal\nEmphasizes cultural responsibility and intellectual authority but ignore progress in intellectual responsibility for the sake of cultural rewards\nneutral\nfor\nfor\nneutral\n\n\nProgressive\nBalances authority with responsibility\nagainst\nfor\nfor\nfor\n\n\nRegressive Left\nsuppress authority of intellect over cultural to emphasize responsibility\nagainst\nfor\nagainst\nfor\n\n\nSocialist\nneutral toward intellectual authority and lack responsibility toward culture by streamlining systems and reducing optionality for the sake of the current culture\nfor\nneutral\nagainst\nagainst\n\n\nCommunism\nfor a monoculture authority and mastering that culture with intellectual authority help but without responsibility at any level\nfor\nfor\nagainst\nagainst\n\n\n\n"},"the_bootstrap/moral-struggles.html":{"url":"the_bootstrap/moral-struggles.html","title":"Moral Struggles","keywords":"","body":"Moral Struggles\nWe can simplify many of our moral discussions by using this framework. In order to do this follow the following steps:\n\nBreak the moving pieces of the problem into the economies at work.\n\nAscribe moral authority to the more advanced economy:\n\n\nIntellectual > Societal > Organic > Inorganic\n\nIf the dilemma is identified as being between two positions inside of a single economy, give authority to the one that shows the most quality / value inside that economy.\n\nIdentify how the agent with moral authority can act with moral responsibility toward each less valuable alternative in its own level and toward any lower level involved.\n\n\nA simple application follows.\nMoral Dilemma:\nA city wants to build a damn down river to generate power for the city and reduce dependence on external energy sources.\nFirst we break down the levels and the impact at each level:\nIntellectual:\nLittle implication - only application.\nSocietal:\nIncrease in resources and productivity for the city.\nPotential Reduced water flow for downstream cities.\nOrganic:\nDestruction of wildlife habitat.\nInorganic:\nReduction in Hydrocarbons released in burning of fossil fuels.\nHumans get in trouble when assessing situations like this when we start trying 'use our intellect' to solve the problem. There really isn't in any Intellectual considerations here. There is no symbolic representation and there is no scientific discovery involved. Of course we need to use scientific discovery to build the dam and to extract the electricity from the flow of water, but these are not really dilemmas. The only implications we have at the intellectual level is the moral standing to say that we reliably know that building the dam will produce the energy we say it will. Think how foolish it would be to affect lower levels if we didn't know this! What if someone were proposing building a giant cement cube in the desert to do the same? We would ask, 'why?' Why do you think this cement block will produce power? All the societal, organic, and inorganic resources going toward it would be folly and ultimately immoral until it were proved that cube could provide more value than would go into it.\nBut we don't have a cube. We have a dam and we know the dam will produce a massive amount of electricity for the nearby city. We can study the economics of the resources this will provide and see that it is a very valuable thing! We can see that building this dam may be a very moral thing to do, but we must take in all possible moral dilemmas into consideration.\nUnfortunately the city down river is not happy about our plan. They fear that the dam will reduce their access to water. Do they have a case? Well if we apply rule 3 of our framework we have to ask a hard question. Who provides more value inside of this economy of society? The answer may be that the downstream entity is a thriving metropolis of 4 million people and a reduction in access to water could start a cholera epidemic and devastate their economy. In this case the dam would be immoral. If the town upriver is bigger and provides economic impact then the other town then building the dam may still be a moral choice.\nHow should the impact between the two cities be determined? This should be a general utility calculation inside of the economic layer. This means in this case you don't figure in the organic or inorganic impact unless it destabilizes the societal layer. Certainly a cholera epidemic in either place would disrupt production and value of existing resources quite a bit! If the impact is that more water will have to be pumped to the down river town and, if you do that, that the net production increase you may still want to do it.\nAt the extreme, this leads to a hard conclusion that building the dam has moral authority even if it ruins the downstream town as long as the long term benefit is more economic output that that town had initially.\nBut don't forget about Rule 4! Don't fall prey to the destructive valley!\nWe must ask about how a town with moral authority to build a dam and potentially destroy a town should also act with moral responsibility to that town. The answer is that it shouldn't destroy the town. It should find a place along the continuum that allows it to reach a significant level of productivity while still preserving the societal value of the smaller town. We don't know the future and all value is future value. We may discover a diamond mine under the smaller town in 15 years that allows the town to overcome any economic disadvantage that was relevant at the time the dam was built.\nOr going the other direction, if the dam is not built because the down river town is more valuable, perhaps it provide some compensation to the other town for not building the dam.\nThere are a million creative solutions that satisfy the moral framework.\nOnce we've satisfied the moral framework at the societal level we still have the lower levels to contend with. In this case there is a real environmental impact for the wild life in the basin that will be flooded by the dam. The framework tells us that the dam has the moral authority to disrupt the organic ecosystem, but can it be done responsibly? An assessment must be made. Does an endangered species live in this basin that would go extinct if the dam were built? If not it is likely that the organic impact will be negligible and the dam can move forward knowing that it is acting with moral responsibility. Perhaps they may want to progressively flood the basin over a number of days to allow the larger animals to move out of the area being flooded. There are certainly questions to be answered, but they are questions of responsibility and not of authority.\nThe fact that the inorganic level will be positively affected by the dam is a plus.\nThe key to the framework is quickly defining the authority and then seeking the responsibility.\nMany of our toughest moral dilemmas in our modern day get contentious when one side tries to elevate the societal over the intellectual. This framework eliminates that contention and just flat out calls out those that would try to put the economy of resources over the economy of intellect.\nWhat if we modified our above example with the fact that the land to be flooded by the dam was owned by a number of private citizens who did not want their land to be flooded. If we adhere to the intellectual ideals of liberty and private property our scenario changes quite a bit. Eminent domain is a tricky thing that our framework ultimately calls immoral. Unless you can compensate those private citizens for their land in such a way that they are willing to cede the property rights to someone else we should not have the moral authority to build the dam. The intellectual authority of liberty will always override the economic authority. But rule 4! These citizens should act with responsibility to the lower economic level. If they see that by giving up their land there will be many more jobs created and many more people will be elevated to a place where they can contribute to the intellectual level, they should act with grace and find a reasonable solution to compensate them for their troubles and get the dam built.\n"},"the_morality_of_the_bootstrap/love.html":{"url":"the_morality_of_the_bootstrap/love.html","title":"Love","keywords":"","body":"Love\nSo where does love fit into all of this? First consider there are different kinds of love. These different kinds of love add up to a very complicated thing that we call 'Love.' We need to break Big L love back down.  This does not discount love. In fact, it may even be an entire other economy that operates at a strange intersection of the biological, societal, and intellectual. We should look at the different kinds of love and see what economies are at work.\nRomantic Love\nRomantic love has its roots in the biological. There is a direct line from our bodies building up feelings of romantic love and our genes being passed on.\nFamilial Love\nFamilial love sits at an interesting intersection between the biological and the societal. Biologically we are drawn to love and care for our relations because they share some quantity of our genes. But the family is also a societal structure that helps control and smooth out access to resources.\nTrusting Love - Friendship\nTrusting love, aka, friendship is an intellectual love. It is, in a sense, trust, and it is why when trust is broken we feel so broken hearted. This kind of love bleeds down and crosses over into our romantic and familial love as well.

If they are different then a bootstrap has occurred. If they are not different then a bootstrap has not occurred and the system has just evolved to a higher level within an economy, possibly, with a higher level of quality. We may still have found a place where we can make a morality judgment because the level is higher in the cascade, but if the economics haven't changed it is not a bootstrap.\nIn the societal layer we find resources being the unit of value. Possessing resources, having access to resources, seeking out resources are the activities that drive the societal system.\nThe state is clearly a higher organization of society. But are the economics different? We see at high levels of the nation state some evidence of an economics of 'power'. How many Senators can be brought to bear on an issue? Ultimately, I don't believe this is a new form of economics though. The decision makers in nation states currently still rely on resources, monetary campaign donations in the US, for their power. Power is still a function of, and therefore directly related to, the resources controlled at a certain level of society.\nIf the State were to separate itself from the effect of resource allocation it may be able to bootstrap. One area where see some leaning this way is with the US Supreme Court. Because this court has lifetime appointments the justices are able to make decisions independent of resource allocation. Unfortunately this is also one of the areas of government where we have the least amount of info of how decisions are made. Cameras aren't allowed in and the interplay of decision making is generally only recorded after the fact in opinions. We completely miss out on the process and what the actual unit of value is that moves an opinion one way or the other.\nLet’s consider for a moment that society reaches a point where the actors in the state are selected by lot in a way that insures that currently controlling more resources doesn't impact your selectability. What would these resource independent statesmen involve themselves in? The population would demand that they engage in the allocation and protection of resources. More of the same.\nIt is my conclusion that the State is not a bootstrap to supersociety. That does not mean that the state is not integral to a bootstrap to the supersociety. In fact our conclusion is that in order for society to bootstrap to a supersociety, resource allocation and use needs to be as optimized as possible. To reach this conclusion we will look at the economics of the previous bootstrap and then explore how to best position society and the state to emulate these process of these economies reaching bootstrap.\n"},"posibility_spaces/":{"url":"posibility_spaces/","title":"Posibility Spaces","keywords":"","body":"Possibility Spaces\nIt should be instructive to look at the jump in possibility space in the inorganic to the possibility space in the biological to realize the significant hurdle to that we have to overcome in finding a society -> supersociety or intelligence -> superintelligence bootstrap. Biology has a super exponential magnitude of possibility space over the inorganic which is probably why we saw significant movement on in the inorganic self organization on the scale of microseconds and while the biological changes can take eons.\nThis is a sobering thought that the next bootstrap has such a massive possibility space. I think that intelligence has given us a hack we can use to short circuit this seemingly unmovable mountain. Our use of the mathematical laws of probability and the mastering of the scientific method will allow us to restrict the possibility spaces.\n"},"the_bootstrap/avoiding-ruts.html":{"url":"the_bootstrap/avoiding-ruts.html","title":"Avoiding Ruts","keywords":"","body":"Avoiding Ruts\nThere are a number of ruts that can keep us from using our intelligence to accelerate the next bootstrap. Many of these can be seen by looking back at history and observing the amazing breakthrough of the enlightenment. For a full exploration of these concepts, please read David Deutsch's The Beginning of Infinity: Explanations That Transform the World.\nAs a short summary, static societies can hinder the advancement of knowledge. These societies get mired in sacredness. This sacredness is an enemy that the enlightenment exposed and that we need to shine a giant spotlight on if we hope to move our society on toward supersociety. All of our knowledge is wrong at some level. At best, we have 'best guesses.' But it is good and right for us to seek out better guesses. This is how human knowledge advances. Sacredness takes one form of knowledge, codifies it, and attempts to apply it all future problems.\nWe must call out sacredness for what it is: horse manure. If you spread enough of it around you can grow some amazing and vibrant societies, but ultimately, they are all set on a foundation of horse dung. Even in our western, and mostly enlightened, religions we are still just pushing around polished turds.\nRitual is different than sacredness. Ritual can give a rhythm to life that tie a society together and makes it stronger. But we must avoid sacred ritual. We must observe our rituals and know what they are and what they mean to accomplish.  And when our knowledge exposes that our rituals were misguided, we must be open to changing them.\nWe don't need to stop going to our manure piles on Sundays or dipping our noses in cow patties five times a day, but we do need to acknowledge the reality of the material we have to work with.  After engaging in those rituals we need to set them aside and take the world as it really is. We need to recognize the superiority of the body of knowledge that we have amassed since the elders put the old words down on parchment. The world we know and the knowledge we have clearly expose the ancient writers for the hack they were, and it is time to start calling a manure spade a manure spade.  We can certainly appreciate their work and mastery of the world they lived in, but taking any kind of advice about the human condition and chief end of man from writers who had no concept of the DNA that drives our body is immediately suspect.  It should all be reevaluated in light of current knowledge.  This also has the implications that the great writers of today will one day look like fools.  We should remember this and stay humble.\n"},"the_bootstrap/moral-imperative.html":{"url":"the_bootstrap/moral-imperative.html","title":"Moral Imperative","keywords":"","body":"Moral Imperative\nOur framework has established moral authority and moral responsibility. These principles can guide us when we are faced with moral conflicts. This leaves us with what our moral imperative should be when we are not faced with conflict. What should we do? What should humanity be about? When we dream, what should we dream of?\nOur observations about the world reveal that the universe is in the business of bootstraps and we draw from this that our moral imperative is for us to be in the business of enabling those bootstraps. Our intelligence lets us come alongside the universe and shepherd bootstraps that are worthy of moral authority and capable of moral responsibility. This requires the synthesis of scientific knowledge and moral philosophy. We need to think deeply about this imperative and experiment around the edges to validate our theories.\nThis imperative can be unsettling. Many of the world's religions and worldviews point to 'things happening for a reason.' Our moral framework douses this idea with the shocking cold water of the reality that the reason things happen is that we did not have the proper knowledge to keep them from happening.\nComing to grips with this reality should stir an urgency in the spirit of humanity. We need to stop looking toward the future to try to justify our cancers. Cancer does not 'happen for a reason.' It doesn't happen so that you can learn something new or become a stronger person. It happens because we do not have enough knowledge. And the knowledge is out there to be had. It happens because we aren't looking for the right answers.\nIt happens because we have not yet developed the knowledge to detect it happening, eradicate it when it happens, and to keep it from happening. Our parents are dying because we have focused on banking, commercialization, and frivolity when we should have been delving the mysteries of biological systems and developing the knowledge to unravel those mysteries. Our moral imperative is being ignored when a majority of our Physics PHDs are applying their limited time on this earth to making money in the financial markets instead of plumbing the depths of the universe's mysteries.\nI do not have a ready answer for what we should do to comfort ourselves when things go sideways. I'm tempted to leave the question unanswered and direct this discomfort toward the future. If the eradication of disease and death is not enough of a carrot on a stick to move us in the right direction, perhaps this discomfort is a burr in our saddle that will cause us to always lean forward and seek relief.\nThe rest of this volume seeks to align our incentives to this moral framework.\n"},"achieving_supersociety/":{"url":"achieving_supersociety/","title":"Achieving Supersociety","keywords":"","body":"Achieving Supersociety\nSociety has the possibility of bootstrapping into an infinite number of supersocieties.

Using the understanding of time that our intellect gives us we will try to thread a needle through a small window of probability that will lead to a safe and productive super society that establishes a justification to any oncoming superintelligence that our supersocity is not only worth keeping around, but worth extending to the edges of the universe.\nI am proposing two advancements to increase our probability of accomplishing these goals.\n\nEstablish a Blockchain based marketplace with hypercatallaxian features\n\nEstablish an extended republic that supports a peaceful global society subject to a common set of hypercatallaian markets.\n\n\nI predict that the Blockchain based system will have the following effects on our society:\nA.

The blockchain is an intellectual construct that is laid on top of the societal layer to increase its robustness. It takes time, the economy of the intellect, and applies it to the economy of society.\nResource based economies are generally time agnostic. Our human-societal brains(System I) will even trick us into taking a smaller sum of cash now than at a point in the future even when the return in the future is ridiculously high. It isn't until the return is so large that our human-intellectual brains(system II) trip and make us say...wait a second....I'll wait.\nThe fact that we accept money as a form of payment is a bit of miracle. We figured out intellectually that a stand in for our sheep and wheat would be advantageous. This timeshifting of resources helps us, but it is subject to a number of bad actions that breaks the trust. In fact we hear often that money is only as good as the trust people put in it. This is true! It is just paper(or bits in a machine). The blockchain takes this to a logical end point by codifying money across time. The problem with money still remains that as market conditions change, the value of money can drastically change.\nIf we want there to be 'enough' money out in the world, there should always be enough to buy all the goods that are being produced. Of course things can change very quickly and things like a war could greatly reduce the amount of output that an economy can generate(or perhaps the value of things produced as bombs tend to be blown up). It is extremely difficult to control the money supply when this happens and it typically leads to some form of instability. But with the blockchain, all transactions can be filtered through a set of intermediaries. If the economy collectively decides that a 1/3 reduction in money supply is necessary, via a blockchain, it can be enforced on the next transaction of each account in the system. I am not suggesting we do anything as drastic as this because it could increase the predictability of markets and, if markets like anything, it is predictability.\nThe blockchain acts as a sort of time machine for our resources. We can walk backwards in time and make decisions based on where money has been and we can put future restrictions on cash via smart contracts. Future proofing anything is tough and so our smart contracts need to really be smart and offer us a means of flexibility. This is going to be an important field of study: figuring out how to maintain flexibility without having a system that can be gamed.\n"},"achieving_supersociety/incentivising_the_flow_of_cash.html":{"url":"achieving_supersociety/incentivising_the_flow_of_cash.html","title":"Incentivising The Flow of Cash","keywords":"","body":"Incentivising The Flow of Cash\nSavings is an interesting thing. We are told from a young age to save our pennies so that we have them for a rainy day. The problem with this is that when our pennies are inactive, there is work out there in the world not being done. There is certainly someone with the ability to create some value if they had access to your pennies.\nCapital reserve banking is supposed to provide this service and must be recognized as having some success over the last few decades as the amount of value that has been created has skyrocketed. Our issue is that the profits from the banking have gone to individuals who own the banks and not to the people that gave the pennies.\nCapital reserve banks do accelerate cash flows as they regularly loan out 10 or more pennies for every one they deposit, but can there be another way that eliminates the profiteering? And what to do with the profits?\nBy requiring a multisignature process for the spending of cash we can implement our money time machine and remove the need for the typical banks. I propose a demurrage on cash so that it decays at rate that encourages the spending and / or investing of cash between market participants.\nThis system will accelerate the flow of cash far beyond the ability of the fractional reserve banking system.

He calls it picking up nickels in front of a steam roller. Bankers take our money and loan it out on the assumption that it is nearly impossible for all the loans to fail at the same time. In doing this they pick up nickels and give us pennies calling it a win-win. That is until all the loans do fail at the same time and the dollars we gave them to get our pennies disappear into thin air. This is a fragile system. Volatility destroys it.\nTo turn it on its head we need a system that is antifragile. That is, volatility should increase our return. Hypercatallaxy accomplishes this in two ways. We loan the dollar to the bank and get a share of the bank's account. Since they are in the business of making loans they loan it to a business. This business spends the cash with other businesses. Some of these businesses do well and other fail. When one fails we can 'fold the blockchain' and connect the source of cash to the destination of cash across an entity. If the dividend comes from the economic activity produced in a specific account then we have a natural activity seeking process that finds the positive black swans and distributes the benefits back through the system via the decaying currency.\nThis form of reducing risk by folding the blockchain extends not just to banking but all forms of financing whether it be venture capital or a loan between family members.\n"},"achieving_supersociety/preserving_democracy.html":{"url":"achieving_supersociety/preserving_democracy.html","title":"Preserving Democracy","keywords":"","body":"Preserving Democracy\nOur technology is driving the world to a smaller and smaller state.

It is my belief that money is unnatural. It does not die and therefore can lead to unfair advantage. With our new form of money we seek to naturalize money and fix a lot of issues along the way.\nThis kind of money is different for 3 core reasons:\n\nOur new money has the property of demurrage. Demurrage is controlled inflation. This means you must constantly spend money to keep your money 'current' and usable.\n\nOur new money demands that a form of artificial capital(aka prefs) be given to the sender of funds along with goods and services in the event of a transaction. Spending our new money is also investing money. The Demurrage from our new money is paid out to owners of this capital. Since no transaction can be performed without the transfer of capital we aim to democratize 'capitalism'.\n\nIt allows taxpayers the right to veto the use of state run accounts. This is a form of ongoing voting that makes the people much more powerful in their democratic self government.  The three pillars of the republic are the executive, the legislative, and the judiciary. We add a fourth check to the balance that is a direct citizen veto of the ability for governments to transact business.\n\n\n'Art' is a proposed technical implementation. There maybe others that are better but I feel like I should not present a problem without some sort of solution proposed.\nWhy Art? We propose that people should be 'compensated for the full output of their labor'. Their labor is their Art. A unit of production echos into the future indefinitely and each laborer should have some right to the value produced from their own labor.\nThis idea of 'full output of labor' was originally a socialist and communist ideal. I in no way want to be associated with those movements. In fact, I have attempted to swing this concept completely on its head. In a sense, my conclusion is that the communists and socialists missed the fact that laborers were not obtaining their full output because society was not capitalistic enough. At the same time, the hypercatallaxy I propose is a much more egalitarian system than our current form of capitalism.\nIn the following sections we discuss a theoretical coin called 'art' which seeks to:\n\ninstitutionalize hypercatallaxian economics\nbring about the simplification of taxes\nend the deathless corporations\nend indentured employment\nprovide for the education of our children\nempower democratic ideals of self government\nincrease transparency\nenrich the laboring class\nreturn the human capital wasted in the finance industry to progressive endeavors\nensure social security and a thriving economy.\n\nIn the first section, 'Generating a new form of money' we seek to form a generative language to lead to the adoption of art as the dominant form of money.\nIt is an over ambitious task to try to tackle all of those things and I would hesitate if the following things were not true:\n\nThe solution is simple.\n\nIt would not be possible to do without digital money.\n\n\nIn 'The Form Language' we take a look at democratic hypercatallaxy and build a form language of items to use in the construction of our new form of money. This section is for those that want to take a deeper look at the concept of democratic hypercatallaxy and the forms that make the engine run.\nIn 'The Pattern Language' we take a look at the pattern language considered for this document. This section is specifically targeted to those that are fans of the pattern language and the work of Christopher Alexander. This section is not required reading for those wanting to understand the basics of democratic hypercatallaxy but is a key component that was developed before we built the form and generative language.\nI know I'm biting off way more than I can chew with this and that is why I'm putting out at this point and hoping to get feedback and help in seeing if some of these ideas are practical and can actually be implemented.\n"},"achieving_supersociety/a-new-form-of-money.html":{"url":"achieving_supersociety/a-new-form-of-money.html","title":"Generating A New Form Of Money","keywords":"","body":"A Generative Language for a new form of money\nOur goal in this book is to outline a (re)generative process that will allow our new form of money to become the dominant form of currency in the near future.

Is it the market or the corporation like today's system seems to revolve around? Is it power and control as totalitarian governments have attempted to implement in the past?\nThe answer that I have arrived at is 'the citizen.' As I lay out this form of money I will ask the reader to consider each element that is layered on and ask themselves, 'how does this enhance the citizen at the center of our monetary system?' Along the way other centers will form around this initial strong center and we want each layer to enhance those sub centers as well.\nThese ideas are explained much more thoroughly in Christopher Alexander's Nature of Order.\nIt is probably worth mentioning why we have not chosen something different as our strongest center. I will include a few notes, but there is a much longer discussion that could be had about the pluses and minuses of each. It also is not that these items are not centers in our system, just that they are not the strongest center. They all have a role to play:\n\nThe Government: We could certainly have the government at the center. In a sense The Fed does this today. It is there 'job' to maintain liquid markets so that things don't go insane among the populace. Things like the great depression make governing difficult. Ultimately though, even liberals don't want government to be the centerpiece. Liberals may want a strong government but it is usually to the end that it help the citizens. The example of Soviet Communism also wards us away from trying to put too much stock in the government as the ultimate center.\n\nThe Market: The economist will point to the market and say that it is the most pure incarnation and that the market will take care of itself. The market! The market! But ultimately we have to make a choice. The market is evolution businessified. It is cold, calculating and has no mercy. Is that the choice we want to make? It may be true that to date it has given the most benefit to the most people and generally pulled the least fortunate along for the ride, but I am going to reject the assumption that we can't do better. Ultimately, I think mercy and grace and redemption are worthwhile ideas. The market has no use of these.\n\nThe Company: The legal entity has been an amazing tool of capitalism. A tool where people are able to unite behind a purpose and pool resources toward that goal is an amazing thing. My problem with the company, at least in the modern C - corporation incarnation is that the those that run the company are always held to make choices with the best interest of stockholder value in mind. Even if those choices would destroy or disrupt other essential centers in the economy(ie. the market, the government, the well being of the people, the natural resources), the board and the executives cannot legally make the center preserving choice. They must make the choice that maximizes the shareholder's value.\n\n\nWe choose the citizen because without lifting up the citizen, these other institutions are meaningless. When these items have taken over in the past and become the end all be all, humanity has suffered. Sometimes from war, sometimes from oppression, sometimes from general lack of welfare.\nI believe that if our system seeks to always put the citizen at the center then we will have created a successful economic system and monetary policy.\nA new form of Money - Art\nAround the center of the citizen we will add a new form of money. I propose to call this new coin 'Art' that has a stable value and conforms to my ideas of democratic hypercatallaxy.\nIn short, this means that 'Art' can be\n\ntraded for goods, but that in addition to the goods, the purchaser will be issued a form of preferred stock called 'prefs' equal to the number of 'Art coins' that are spent.\n\n'demurraged' or 'degraded' as a natural course so that money cannot be hoarded and as a means to pay a dividend to 'pref' holders and to collect taxes.\n\nused as a form of voting in society in which citizens can 'veto' the power of a government accounts to transact business, in effect, demanding change or requiring the reformation of the agency under different governance. Votes are limited to one per account and the number of votes one has is not tied to the amount of cash in an account or the number of prefs in the account, but to the account’s election of taxation to fund the agency.\n\n\nBecause of these properties, this form of money is a digital currency, issued under an issuing authority. There are not physical bills.\nCitizen Accounts\nThis money will need to be held in 'accounts.'\nNot all accounts will be equal.\nCitizens will have citizen accounts. These are the central accounts in the system. These accounts have the most power and freedom within the system.\nAn account will be issued to each 'citizen' that is qualified. Typically this will be a resident in a specific geographic area, although that definition may change over time. It is a human being though, and not a group of humans. One Citizen, one account.\nState Accounts\nIn my ideal scenario, the state is the issuer or the currency. I do not expect this to be the way that things start out, but I think that for the near future, this should be an end goal. I do not anticipate that humanity is quite ready to throw off the concept of the nation state.\nThe State will have an issuing account and its agencies will have agency accounts. Sub governments like states and counties will have their own domain accounts and their sub agency accounts.\nState accounts have the least amount of power because a group of citizens have the power to 'veto' the account and disable its use. Until the state or its agency comply with the demands of the citizens, or until a larger group of citizens overturns the veto, the agency cannot do business.\nCitizens can elect to come under the domain of certain state type accounts. An example of this would be a resident of Texas coming under the Texas State account. The The Texas state account will have its own set of taxes. In this way, a citizen can join many theoretical 'state' organizations. Another example might be a union that the citizen is a member of. They want a portion of their demurrage to go to the support of that union so they elect to be taxed by that account. They also gain voting rights over that account when they are taxed by it.\nLegal Entities\nLegal Entities will have Legal Entity accounts. Legal entity accounts have a bit less power than citizen accounts. The cannot vote and cannot initiate private transactions but can receive them.\nIn addition, Legal Entities will be subject to a demurrage of ownership. In exchange for Limited Liability, a portion of ownership in a legal entity will demurrage to the commons each year.  This stock will be put up for auction on a public marketplace.  Bids will be taken.  The highest bid will win the stock unless the original owners match the bid price.  In either case, the amount paid for the stock will flow to the federal government to fund a majority of its operation.\nDomestic Passthroughs\nOne more type of account, the Domestic Passthrough, will allow domestic partners the ability to channel all household transactions and salary receipts through a centralized account.  This structure will allow for the orderly dissolution and distribution of the prefs associated with such accounts if the domestic arrangement is terminated.\nTransactions - Accountability and the Blockchain\nAccounts will have a number of ways to transfer money around. Debit cards and online payment will be available. Transfer will be as close to instant as possible.\nTransaction blocks will be signed and pushed to a bitcoin like blockchain that will ensure the validity of the transactions and keep the state from fudging the numbers behind the scenes.\nA lot of hand wringing has gone on about how to use cryptocurrency in a way that ensures governments are left out of the equation when it comes to the next form of money. I believe this is a wrong headed approach. Instead of trampling all over the idea of rule of law, I think we should use this amazing technology to keep rule of law accountable. In this system all government transactions will be public and searchable. In addition they cannot be reversed or made not to exist because they will be recorded in the blockchain and distributed. This allows us to have a strong central authority, but also one that is held accountable by its citizens.\nThe actual accounts will be under the central authority of the state and centralized. The blockchain will not be centralized and will be distributed across a peer to peer network. In this way the entire transaction history will be stored off site and could be reconstructed in the event of catastrophe.\nPrefs\nEach transaction will be accompanied by the transfer of prefs. Prefs entitle the owner to a portion of the pref payment that is produced on each account. If I receive a pref dividend from an account that I own prefs in, it will be split into 3 parts.\nFirst the tax will be figured. Say my account's total tax rate is 25% and my payment is $100. $25 will be deposited in the state agencies that my tax flows into. If the pass through rate is 33%, the remaining $75 will be split into $25 and $50. I will receive the $50 in my account and the $25 will be 'passed through' to the accounts that own prefs in my account. This all occurs on a 'catch up.'\nThe central system will force accounts to catch up on a monthly basis, but generally accounts will catch up more often as they engage in commerce. A account cannot claim its pref payments, accept money, or pay money unless it is caught up.\nThe motto is 'No cash without capital.' This will be the refrain of the consumer and will compel the rest of the economic system to move to our form of money.\nDemurrage\nWhere does this $100 payment come from? The prefs accounts earn are a form of preferred stock. Instead of getting a dividend off of the profits an account earns, the pref dividend is based off of a demurrage rate that the issuing authority sets to keep inflation near 0.\nDemurrage is controlled inflation. It causes money to degrade in a straight line, expected fashion. If money demurrages in a state account, it ceases to exist. In any other type of account it is distributed to the pref owners. When the payment is processed, a portion will be collected as tax.\nAs a natural result, as an account does more and more business, it will distribute more and more prefs. When cash in the account is demurraged, it will be distributed more and more broadly as time goes on. As a natural result, new accounts will eventually be reluctant to do business with older accounts as they will gain less of a share than by purchasing from newer accounts. This is part of the life cycle of an account. On the plus side, accounts that have been doing business with the account for years will continue to do so. I see this pattern in human relationships and we think that extending it to the way we execute commerce will generate a more progressive form of commerce where companies are able to evolve ways of doing business much more rapidly.\nA replacement for Commercial Banking\nThe issuing state will also regulate the loan pool. The loan pool works can work in a number of different ways and I'm not sure which should emerge as the dominant model.\nThe first way works in much the same way that the existing fractional reserve banking system works. The key difference is that citizens will reap the benefit of the loans instead of the banks.\nAll accounts will have a portion of their balance that is 'protected' from demurrage. This amount will be aggregated and put up for loan by the central authority. It will be multiplied by a reserve requirement factor that will allow us to issue an amount higher than in the pool. This rate, along with the demurrage rate can be used to ensure that we keep enough money in the system to purchase all that is produced and yet still have a means to extract money from the system in times of crisis.\nAs an effect of demurrage, the interest rate will be close zero for short term loans. How then do we keep a run on the bank from occurring? And what are we going to do with all the banker that are now out of work? We will answer these questions in a later section.\nA second method could be for the government to just issue the loan pools to the groups of loan officers in the same way that the fed currently issues money to commercial banks. This will likely require a higher demurrage rate so that the money can be pulled back out of the economy at a higher rate.\nA third method could be to just let loan pools emerge naturally. If the infrastructure provides for the tracking of loans it is likely that a market place will emerge for collecting 'deposits' and issuing them out as 'loans' as banks do today. In this case the prefs would flow in the same way as our first proposal, but citizens will need to be more proactive to move their cash into these deposit type accounts.\nA new kind of banker\nLoan officers will bid for the rights to distribute the loans to the public. These bids will be distributed to the accounts that put up the cash to be lent out. In this way those that are holding money can defray some of the demurrage value.\nWhy would loan officers bid cash on loans that are going to make 0% interest? The key here is that in issuing the loan, the cash will pass through the loan officers account and they will be issued prefs in the account that is borrowing the money. While the loan is paid out the loan officer will have skin in the game and will do what they can to help the account owner be successful in commerce because they will be a direct beneficiary. If they are successful enough they can forgive a portion of the loan and convert it into a set of permanent prefs. In the current system, the banker is only as interested as the loan balance is outstanding.\nIn a sense these new loan officers will become a type of long term venture capitalist. They will typically be people who have access to cash and have demonstrated their abilities in commerce already.\nEnhancing Education\nEducation is one of the most underpaid careers in the modern world. It is truly a shame and teachers are never compensated for the production they give to the world. I propose that for each year that goes by, a 'cohort fund' is created. Each student is allocated a set of prefs and the cohort fund gains that number of prefs in the student. Teachers also earn prefs in the cohort fund. As a result, the long term earning potential of teachers is drastically improved. As students enter the workforce, their demurrage payments will begin accumulating in the cohort fund and pass through to all the teachers that helped teach them.\nI understand that this may have some significant and ugly side effect such as teachers only wanting to teach in wealthy areas and only teaching successful students. There may be ways to correct these imbalances, perhaps by making the cohort pools statewide.\nStatutory Theft\nPrefs can not be traded on the open market. Any entity or citizen that schemes to try to lay a claim on the value of prefs or to future revenue from prefs will be guilty of Statutory Theft. In a sense, the collected prefs become a part of a person and cannot be sold and no other entity can have dominion over them. In the same way that one cannot sell themselves into slavery, they cannot sell their prefs or the rights to the benefits of those prefs.\nModified Bankruptcy\nBankruptcy will change slightly for citizens. All existing capital can be wiped out from an account, but past a certain date, the 'clear out date', the creditors can lay no more claim on new income. The creditors can also not take the right to payments on past prefs earned in the future. Their payback must come from prefs earned after the bankruptcy date and via the prefs they own in the entity.\nCorporate Bankruptcy will be very different. Bankrupt companies or companies that just go 'out of business' can have the blockchain folded over them in such a way that the prefs they own will be passed on to the entities that own prefs in them in proportion to the percentage of pref ownership.\nEnd of Life\nA percentage of prefs will expire when a citizen or entity ceases to exist. This will refresh the pool of prefs for younger generations. Some prefs may be inherited, but this should be tightly restricted.\nInflation controls\nA CPI authority will be in charge of regulating inflation by recommending adjustments to the Demurrage, Retaining, Issuance, and Pass Through Rates. This authority will actually go out and buy a basket of goods in a broad set of geographic locations. This will determine the inflation rate. This number will strive to be as close to 0 as possible.\nWhat regulations?\nOutside of these bounds, commerce and markets will operate much as they do now free of over-regulation.\nThe nice thing about this system is that the 'software' takes care of most of this without oversight and intervention. Citizens have access to the blockchain and can self regulate.\nThis 'dream state' is not easily achieved due to a number of assumptions that we will discuss in the next chapter.\n"},"achieving_supersociety/assumptions.html":{"url":"achieving_supersociety/assumptions.html","title":"Assumptions","keywords":"","body":"Assumptions\nWhy can this system not be jump started?\nI assume that citizens will be very skeptical at first. They will need to be 'trained' to understand the idea of prefs and the financial impact they can have on their life.\nI assume that this system will be very disruptive to the powers that be. We anticipate the distraction of the populace via war, patriotism, and slander. We must find a way to encourage people to look at the respect for humanity our system seeks to employ.\nI assume the state will not run with this from the get go. We will provide for the eventual nationalization of the system. This is not something to be feared and should be planned for from the beginning. This system could lead to a nation-stateless society, but if history is any indication we are not quite ready for that.\nI assume that merchants would be skeptical as well. Why would they want a money that 'dies' unspent? We will have to overcome these fears by encouraging the populace to demand the acceptance of Art.\nI assume the banks will fight this tooth and nail. It will be for the people to demand the reduction of the financial industry. Ultimately we don't expect this to be a hard sell, but we do expect the industry to fight with all their power to keep the status quo.\nI assume 'they' will call these ideas 'communist', 'socialist', 'unrealistic', etc. Remember the mantra, 'if capitalism is so great, then I demand capital for my dollar.' Together, we need to no longer let ourselves be taken advantage of by those have the power.\nI also assume that this is doable. Art has a secret weapon.\n"},"achieving_supersociety/seed-to-vision.html":{"url":"achieving_supersociety/seed-to-vision.html","title":"Seed To Vision","keywords":"","body":"Seed to Vision\nThe secret weapon of Art is that with a tax rate of 0, and demurrage rate of 0, it is just money. Same as it ever was.\nI want to seed the network with a standard debit card. This will necessitate the establishment of a bank. If we can convince the public that this is an endeavor worth exploring they will put their dollars with us.\nWhen a dollar comes into us we can convert it to an Art at a 1:1 transaction rate pegged to the dollar.\nDuring education and proliferation, this rate will stay 1:1.\nWe will begin issuing prefs as soon as accounts that are both with our bank transact. We can begin the blockchain with these transactions. When someone transacts with a non-account holder we can push the Art to a 'exchange fund' and distribute dollars. The exchange fund will be our responsibility. When new dollars come in we can sell them the art from the exchange fund. The goal will to expand the amount of cash that stays inside the network.\nEventually, with enough art in the system and stable expenditure patterns we can flip the demurrage switch. We can start it very small and keep the tax rate at 0. This will begin to start redistributing some cash via catch up. This will accelerate the adoption as people receive their statements and see the source of the increases in their accounts.\nOnce this process starts we can begin to put more pressure on merchants to open an Art account.\nThis is the key driver of Art. If the market reacts in the way we expect it to, Art will be what everyone will want to spend. Spending a dollar will get you nothing but the good purchased. Spending an Art will get you capital and the good. People may not want to hold Art for long periods of time, but when they go to transfer it to other currencies they will find a limited market for art as everyone rushes to hold Art and the capital that comes with it.\nOnce the technology infrastructure is in place to accept Art as a separate entity to dollars we can break the 1:1 dollar to Art ratio and let the market take over. This poses a significant risk to the organization we have started as the dollars we hold may soon begin to degrade in value.\nAt this point we begin to look toward nationalization. We expect the allure of easy taxation to be too much for the state to resist. With the population clamoring to exchange their dollars for Art we expect the quick nationalization of the system. We will transfer the issuing account to the government.\nGovernment payments will begin to go out in the form of Art instead of dollars. Once this occurs the democratic phase of our system will kick in. Once people are paying taxes to the issuing account they will have the power to lock the account. The government will need to issue citizen accounts to all citizens.\nAt this point we will see if this whole thing works or not. I don't always hack the economy, but when I do, I do it in America.\nSo our Generative language is as follows:\n\nEquivalence - Provide a form of money that is equivalent to the dollar.\n\nEducation - Educate the public on the advantages of the pref system.\n\nDistribution - Flip the Demurrage switch and start distributing economic rents to the participants.\n\nCompulsion - Art is magnetic and people are compelled to use it as opposed to other coins because it has an intrinsic advantage and leads to an optimized and supercharged economy.\n\nDisconnect - We disconnect the exchange rate of 1:1 with the dollar.\n\nNationalization - We allow the government to nationalize the currency as the dollar begins to fail.\n\nDemocratization - Government agencies begin to be affected by the citizen veto and true democracy is established.\n\n\n"},"achieving_supersociety/what-is-missing.html":{"url":"achieving_supersociety/what-is-missing.html","title":"What is Missing?","keywords":"","body":"What is missing?\nAt this point this section is extremely short.

This chapter was originally a blog post on http://catallax.info.\nThe things we will focus on in this section are the ideas of demurrage or the decay fee and the idea of the prefered stock that is exchanged with each and every cash transaction in a hypercatallaxian economy.\nINTRO\nAs a short review, if I buy a bottle of wine for $10, I get the wine and 10 ‘shares’ in the wine merchants account.  If that $10 sits in his account for 1 year at a 12% decay rate, I will receive back $1.20.  If he spends the money, he gets 10 shares in someone elses account and I only get 12% of his $1.20.  This is recursive and cumulative so eventually I will see most of my cash back.\nMany stop here and either don’t believe me or think I’m doing some funny math.  I’ll be the first to admit that I’m not great at the maths.  I’m trying to get better and I’m specifically looking for someone interested in mentoring me through the relevant bits.  What I am decent at is computer programming and building models, so in this article I’m going to publish a very basic model that will hopefully be intriguing enough to get some people to PAY ATTENTION and help me move the ball toward the goal.\nThe argument against capitalism that I put forward is that while it does a great job of rewarding capitalistic investment, and to an extent capitalistic banking, it does a poor job of leveraging the general economic buying and selling that goes on in the economy.  Investors seek value creation, but consumers are just interested in the ‘best deal’ irrespective of the producers potential future value creation.\nFor example, take two apples priced at $1.00 and $1.01.  Apple 1 is made on a farm that abuses laborers, abuses its soil, and is generally poorly run.  Apple 2 is made on a farm that uses sustainable methods and is just in general a ‘better’ apple farm.  It is clear that apple farm 1 will likely be out of business within the year, but the consumer doesn’t care.  They buy apple 1 because it is cheaper for the same commodity.  It would be better for everyone if you bought 2, but you aren’t going to.  You have no incentive too.\nThis is a problem and now I have the model to prove that it is a problem.  And it is a potentially huge problem.  If we can fix this problem we can drastically increase our GDP.\nTHE MODEL\nHere are the assumptions of this model:\nSome nodes are better than other nodes at extracting rent for a good.\nSome nodes are better than other nodes and noticing the potential for cash transferred to another node.  In other words, I’m better than you at investing in wine makers because I was one for 10 years and you just buy wine at the store.\nStandard capitalism just refreshes capital at nodes that succeed in #1, and nodes that use #2 to invest.  Hypercapitalism uses all economic activity when refreshing nodes in #2.\nMy theory is that is that the more you refresh the nodes that are good at producing value and the nodes that are good at seeking value, you will have a more robust economy with much higher growth.\nNodes in #1 are refreshed by people buying and selling goods that they value.  If a node attracts revenue then it will have more resources to create value.\nNodes in #2 are refreshed in Hypercapitalism by charging the decay fee in an account and passing it back to those that paid into the account in proportion to how much they paid into the account.\nTherefore I take a set of node N1...9 and assign each node an Economic Rent production value and a p(Reason) value.\nThe pER is the rate at which that node produces Economic Rent on top of a sale.  So if someone is going to buy my good worth $1 and and my pER is 0.94, I will sell it for $1.94 (1 + pER) * amount.  In this way the rich get richer.  If you are good at producing economic rent you are going to make a lot of money.  I am not making a judgment about whether the economic rent is good economic rent or bad economic rent, just that it is charged.  I set these up in a natural distribution centered around n5.\nThe pReason value is the probability that a node will spend its money with a worthwhile node.  This is a nodes ‘investment sense.’  Some of us are better than others at looking at who has made something and being able to make some predictions about their future earning potential.  Some of us are Warren Buffet and some of us are Mr. Magoo.  In this model the reason is a straight line increasing as we increment n.  This is what we end up with:\n\n\n\nNode\npER\npReason\n\n\n\n\nn0\n0.01\n0.00\n\n\nn1\n0.05\n0.10\n\n\nn2\n0.19\n0.20\n\n\nn3\n0.47\n0.30\n\n\nn4\n0.80\n0.40\n\n\nn5\n0.96\n0.50\n\n\nn6\n0.80\n0.60\n\n\nn7\n0.47\n0.70\n\n\nn8\n0.19\n0.80\n\n\nn9\n0.05\n0.90\n\n\n\nn0 is dismal.  It can produce barely any rent and has no reason.  It will spend without prejudice.  n5 is a rockstar capitalist.  It can produce massive rents and it has reasonable reason.  n9 can’t produce much rent but almost always makes good decisions.  You are free to fork the code and change these up and/or hotwire them.  I felt like this gave me a good base to work with.\nWe are going to let our nodes participate in an economy for 300 months(25 years).  Each node will have to spend $50 a month on necessities or it will suffer a ‘poverty month’.  Poverty months are not fun.  In addition to the $50, nodes will spend some ‘disposableCash’.  To get disposable cash I subtract a years worth of expenses from a nodes balance, and then divide the result by 12.  In other words, after expenses, they can spend about 1/12 of their cash.  In reality we pick a random percent between 25-75 to pick how much they spend.\nWhich node they spend their cash at is determined by their reason.  They have pReason probability of picking the node that produces the most value(Economic Rent).  If they fail, they move down a rung and test again.  If they get all the way to the end they just pick a random node.  As a result, a node with great pReason will spend most of their cash over the 25 years with firms that are great at producing Economic rent.\nAfter each month we do the demurrage or decay calculation and pass cash back to the nodes that seeded the cash in a node according to the ideas in hypercapitalism. Now the interesting thing about capitalism is that it is just hypercapitalism with a 0% demurrage rate and a 0% tax rate(We are ignoring taxes in this model).  So for capitalism we just set the demurrage rate to 0.  \nWe are giving all capitalist consumers the benefit of the doubt that they make decisions based on reason.  I’ve run the simulation without reason and when I do I end up with a 16% decrease in GDP when consumers are not incentivised to use reason.  Poverty actually went down because the disbursement of cash was more random.  I wasn’t expecting to discover this as it really gives us a reason to debate if we want to use reason or not because it may lead to short term poverty when the really, really unproductive nodes begin to be ignored by the market.  I’m not totally convinced this is a  bad thing though.\nIn the end I contend that ‘reason’ is amplified by the decay fee and pref dividends.  We certainly have some incentive to use reason in our consumption(although currently it is mostly guilt), but having a hypercatallaxian system will amplify this.  This model may not accurately represent the exact flows of this kind of reason, but I think it does a good job of simulating the outer bounds and we can use these to reason within.\nThis is not supposed to be a ‘realistic’ model of the economy.  That being said, it is AN economy and I think it is reasonable to say that it is a decent representative economy.  I can and must keep building more detailed models with more nodes, taxes, money supply growth, innovation, etc, but I have to start somewhere.\nI give each node $1000 to start out with.  Let’s take a look at the results.\nPOVERTY\nThe first result to take a look at is poverty.  Some of these nodes are going to run out of cash and not be able to buy necessities.  Now I’m all for free markets but I’m also generally against hunger.  I’d love a system that just intrinsically takes care of this and I’ve tried to put that into hypercapitalism.  I wasn’t sure that it would reduce poverty, but the results seem to bear it out.\nWe see in this chart that the amount of poverty is significantly reduced as we redistribute wealth in a manner that sends it back to those that spent the cash with the wealth generators.\n\nFig 6.1 We see in this chart that the amount of poverty is significantly reduced as we redistribute wealth in a manner that sends it back to those that spent the cash with the wealth generators.\nOur model only has 3,000 months in it. The fact that over 1/3 of them end up being poverty months under standard capitalism makes this a pretty sorry economy. As you can see here, the increase in decay fee has a profound effect of poverty.  I don’t know if politics and good sense could endure a 60% decay rate, but with it we cut the poverty rate by over 50%.\nINCREASING GDP\nThis is a nice result but it doesn’t speak to my initial prediction that the economy will grow.  After all, we could just do some redistribution via taxes and get a similar result.  So let’s look at GDP in Fig 6.2.\n\nFig. 6.2 Increasing the amount we redistribute to optimized value seeking nodes increase the GDP of our economy.\nWe can see here a clear increase in GDP as we increase the decay fee.  This is the result that I expected when I proposed the model.  How can this be?  When you remove cash from those that have it and give it to anyone you may not see this increase, but when you take it and give it to people that are good at spending it with value creators you increase GDP.\nWe can see how much ing Fig. 6.3.\n\nFig 6.3 Our model shows some increase at each step in the increase in decay fee.\nThe total increase in GDP when we go to 60% is 8.2% in GDP over 25 years.  This is an increase of an average of 0.3% per year.  This does not seem like much until you consider that since the 90s we’ve been averaging around 2.5% this is a 12% increase in GDP which ends up being huge.\nAt this point I hope it is clear that using this type of redistribution is worth exploring further and potentially interesting enough to implement. I wish I could use this kind of money today.  \nCONTROL GROUP\nWe’ve missed one key consideration of science.  It is one thing to compare a 0% decay fee to a 20% decay fee in a hypercapitalism context.  We haven’t yet compared a different form of redistribution to the hypercapitalism form of redistribution.  The form of redistribution I chose to compare it to was even distribution.  I implemented a wealth tax equal to the demurrage rate but instead of distributing based on hypercapitalism, I did an even redistribution.  When I first ran this in the model I was floored because it basically negated my theory.  See Fig. 6.4.\n\nIf we used reason in picking where we spend our money, we would not need hypercapitalism.  The market does not use reason and instead seeks the best immediate value without regard to the future value of production.\nIt took me a while to realize that this scenario still relied on our consumers using reason, but by removing hypercapitalism I’m removed the driver of reason.  If your redistribution is going to be even, why would you focus your spending with firms that promise future value?  I added some code to apply the even redistribution without the driver of reason and received the result seen in Fig 6.5.\n\nAn increase in taxation when there is no reason to the market leads nowhere.\nThe first thing we notice is that GDP starts about 16% below where it started when we used reason.  This makes sense.  If people are not spending their cash with value creators then the value creators won’t be making enough money.  We see here the redistribution has little to no reliable effect on the GDP.\nCONCLUSION\nAfter reviewing this model I think it is clear that the the adding a driver to use reason is a reliable way to increase GDP.  If you agree I’d encourage you to read up on more of my ideas at http://catallax.info and help support our patreon.\nI have published this model in the source code for this book on github and in a runnable version at \nhttp://runnable.com/VTBkszswv6lIdEFR/hypercapitalism-sample-economy-for-node-js-and-hello-world\nThis model is currently in ‘monte carlo’ mode where it will generate random numbers and create wacky economies.  The goal is to show that most economies benefit from hypercatallaxy.  If you find one that doesn’t let me know.  The ones that don’t seem to benefit are the ones where everyone has a pretty much even ability to generate economic rent.  This makes sense as this is negating our assumption that some people are better value producers than others.  As a bonus, in these scenarios, poverty is usually eliminated even as GDP stays fairly flat.\nIf you want to run the standard test from above, you will need to follow the comments in the top of the server.js file.\nHave fun and let me know how your testing goes.\n\n\\newpage\n"},"achieving_supersociety/the-form-language.html":{"url":"achieving_supersociety/the-form-language.html","title":"The Form Language","keywords":"","body":"The Form Language\nWe have chosen the name Democratic Hypercatallaxy to speak towards our systems key concepts of the democratic veto and the issuing of capital upon each transaction.\nIn this book we will flesh out our form language for our new money and provide conceptual details.

This is the state agency(or corporation) issuing the currency. The currency's ability to function and the issuer's ability to uphold rule of law are key to an entity actually being able to support a currency.\nAn example of an issuing account would be The United States of America or The European Union.\nA strong corporation could, for a time support a currency with the future view of nationalizing the currency when it gains enough steam to override the national currency.\nDomain accounts are accounts that the Issuer can charter to offer public services and to operate in the public interest. These Accounts can collect Elective taxes.\nExamples are a State government in the United States or a country account in the EU. There can also be much smaller agencies. A dock workers union account could be chartered and dock workers, and anyone wanting to support the dock workers, could elect to pay taxes to the union and get a vote. Agency Accounts have the power to select their members.\nDomain and Issuer state accounts will issue citizens the right to veto their ability to 'catch up.' If an account cannot 'catch up' then it cannot issue payment, receive payment, or claim pref payments. More will be discussed on this in the chapter on Veto.\nThe final type of account is an agency account. These accounts do not have taxes collected but instead have funds distributed to them by the agency or issuer accounts. The amount is dependent on the budget set forward by rule of law.\nA good example of this type of account would be a city police department that is issued funds by the city domain account. It would be onerous to have to elect taxes for every city service you wanted to participate in. With agency accounts, citizens gain access to the service also get a selective veto. The selective veto allows citizens to bar payments from the domain account to one of its agency accounts. In this way, selective political action can be taken, even if only symbolic to defund one distastefully run area of government without disrupting essential services.\nAnother feature of state accounts is that they cannot participate in the private pool for either receiving or transmitting payments.

They can also veto the issuing of funds from one domain account to its agency accounts.\nA citizen account may also have the ability to elect a geographic location to establish a residency. Geographically based government entities can use this election to establish residency in the entity.

Legal Entity accounts can have additional taxes, but cannot have less.\nLegal Entity Accounts may also issue shares of ownership that can be traded. If the legal entity elects to be a limited liability entity then these shares will be subject to the Liability Rate and this amount of ownership will demurrage to the commons, in proportion to the amount owned, from all shareholders.  The demurraged stock will be put up for auction.  The original owners may match the high bids to retain ownership.  The cash collected from the sale will fund the issuing entity.

Our goal is for there to always be enough money to buy all the things that are being produced. As production tends to vary and sometimes degrade, it may be necessary to increase and/or remove money as needed.\nDemurrage is our way to 'remove money' from the supply and to 'accelerate' the flow of money through the system.\nDemurrage was initially fleshed out by Silvio Gesell in the last century. The concept was to require that a price be paid to keep money 'current'. This was called stamped money and it had some limited success in times of economic upheaval. It did not last though.  It is a very cumbersome thing to implement with physical money. Demurrage 'naturalizes' money in the sense that now money can 'die'. If you hold onto it for too long, it will disappear.\nTraditionally inflation does this as well, but inflation is erratic and hard to predict. Demurrage can be planned for and controlled.\nThe digital age gives us a chance to try demurrage again.\nWe have modified traditional demurrage with the idea of prefs. As a result, not all demurrage cash goes to taxes. We are going to use the public ledger to pass some cash back to the people that helped us make the cash in the first place.\nMoney will demurrage at a set rate. Instead of requiring everyone to 'stamp' their money once a month we will require an account that wants to spend money, receive money, or process pref payments to 'catch up' and pay the portion of the yearly percentage since the last catch up.

The issuing of this form of artificial capital is intrinsic to the system.\nThe benefit of owning a pref is that the owners of a pref will receive a dividend payment whenever cash 'demurrages' in an account.\nThis is the method that we have chosen to distribute to a citizen the full output of their labor.\nThis concept is based on the pattern 'predistribution of economic rents.'\nThe belief here is that as one participates in the economy, one should be rewarded when that participation leads to a growth in the economy. Currently the economic rent that companies generate goes to shareholders. We are not against value added profit being distributed to shareholders, it is the economic rent, or the 'super profit' that leads to an imbalance in equality in a society.\nWe take economic rent as a reality. Perfect competition and perfect markets are not real. When an economic rent is paid, we want that person who paid it to gain a future advantage. This is the payment of the demurrage dividend.\nOver a number of years of participating in the economy it is likely that a citizen will establish a significant flow of pref payments and will be free to pursue retirement and or a more fitting career free of the worry of how they will pay for their next meal.\nHow does this work in principal? Say an account is catching up. Its balance is $1000 and it has not caught up in a month. The demurrage rate is 12% per year and thus the cash is demurraging 1% or $100. We will assume that taxes are 0% for this example. If an account owns 200 out of a total 2000 prefs in the demurraging account(10%), the owning account will receive a $10 pref payment. The demurraging accounts new balance is now $900 and it can send and receive payment as well as claim any pref payments that have been sent to this account.\nPrefs should be netted between two accounts so that they cannot collude to overtake a majority position in an account. If citizen A pays citizen B $5000 and later citizen B pays back $3000, the net prefs should be $2000 owned by citizen A in citizen B.\nBecause all activity will be in the public ledger it should be simple to create functions that can seek out and find colluding activity seeking to overtake pref ownership.\n"},"achieving_supersociety/legacy.html":{"url":"achieving_supersociety/legacy.html","title":"Legacy","keywords":"","body":"Legacy\nLegacy occurs when it is time to remove an account from the system.\nFor citizens this occurs at death.

We'd like for this rate to be a progressive rate.\nFor individuals with a small amount of prefs, most should be passed on as a legacy. For massive stockpiles of prefs, most will need to be forfeited. This will help keep capital from accumulating and centralizing over time.\nFor Corporations that cease to exist, all prefs owned by the legal entity should distribute to the pref owners. The prefs will degrade when the owners pass away. Some corporation accounts can become 'pass through' accounts where taxes do not get charged to prefs passing through. This is an alternative to legacy for corporations.

Most laborers see this as a goal in life. If not for them, at least to save enough wealth and provide enough education that their children can.\nHow will our system look to the laborer?\nMuch will not change for the laborer in her day to day life initially. She will continue to work for a wage. Only after a number of prefs have built up in the laborer's name and on the laborer's account will things begin to change.\nWith an increase in the prefs that a laborer owns, the laborer will begin to gain more and more, and larger and larger pref payments. These payments will help supplement the laborers income. Eventually, after years, the payments will become large enough that a bout with illness will not put the laborer in a bind.\nEventually the laborer's payments will be equal to a year's wage and allow the laborer to 'retire' to purse further education, art, a desired career, the nurturing of family, or remain working with the privilege of an elevated income.\nThe laborer will be able to see where the prefs are coming from, and since they are coming from entities that the laborer has paid money into, a sense of community and reliance on community will increase.\nWhat of the prefs in the laborer's account that are owned by the wage payer?

The public ledger is a place where the capitalist can record her ownership of real capital, artificial capital, and loans to debtors. This helps the capitalist secure her assets.\nWhat about artificial capital? We discussed earlier that artificial capital is not natural. Things that do not die and fade away seem to go against natural law and lead to problems of imbalance and inequality. Our system address the idea of artificial capital in corporations by implementing to the diminishing value of economic rents. A corporation will eventually have so many prefs owned in its account that it will be unattractive for new market participants to do business with that entity. As a result corporations will eventually die. So while the artificial capital in that business may not fade, the underlying asset will.\nReal capital tends to degrade on its own and require investment to maintain its value.\nUltimately, capital will continue to concentrate without some release valve. For this we propose a heavy capital tax as a part of the Legacy process. This allows a capitalist the fruits of her labor during her lifetime, but distributes the proceeds back to society at the end of her life.\nUltimately the burden on the capitalist is increased. Some of the economic rents that would be paid to the capitalist will now be distributed via demurrage. In addition the the companies that the capitalist is investing in will have a shorter shelf life and she will need to be proactive in timing the selling of an asset.\nThis new system is 'less fair' to the capitalist than the current system. This by design as we feel the capitalist has an unnatural advantage under non-hypercatallaxian.\nThe upside for the capitalist is a massive reduction in risk for the capitalist. Currently, when a capitalist invests in a company 100% of the capital is at risk. Under hypercatallaxy, as the invested in company spends the invested money it will begin to accumulate prefs. These prefs will find their way into profitable parts of the economy and even if the business is a complete bust, it is likely that some capital will eventually be returned to the investors in the form of predistributed economic rents from some tangential industry that they helped thrive.\nWe believe this trade off will increase the possibility scope of what capitalists will be willing to pursue. This will tap as of yet unaddressed human ingenuity and productivity.

Capital\n... how can one create and maintain value in an economic piston (EPI) what can one purchase with Money (MNY) that is not consumable?\nIf money is going to degrade as everything else in nature, how can one preserve value and grow one's position in culture?\nAlmost anything can be capital.  An apple is capital for the time it is ripe, and then maybe in a compost heap.  It is certainly not a stable piece of capital as it rots easily and can be consumed.\nCapital is any asset that is expected to produce money at a point in the future. Wikipedia says: \" capital consists of any produced thing that can enhance a person's power to perform economically useful work—a stone or an arrow is capital for a caveman who can use it as a hunting instrument, and roads are capital for inhabitants of a city.\"\nSo one can buy capital or produce capital via work.  One form of capital is land, although it is not produced it is still a type of asset and can produce rents.  We will distinguish between artificial capital and real capital later on.\nCapital tends to depreciate and requires investment to maintain value.\nIt is also the property of capital that it tends to concentrate when not physically disrupted by war or legislation.  Much of the class struggle of the last 350 years has been due to capital concentrating at the expense of labor that helped produce the capital.\nWhy does this happen?  When a laborer exchanges his work for money, the capitalist gains the right to the product of his labor.  Because money is finite and the laborer must use some of his wages for consumption, more and more value is concentrated in the capitalist's hands.\nThis may end up being the ultimate downfall of capitalism.  If the gap between capital and labor grows too large, the labor class has typically revolted.  This has been managed a bit by progressive policies on income, but ultimately income is only a piece of the equation.  Capital is hard to tax because many items of capital are not liquid.  If everyone agrees a tractor is worth 500 dollars but no one is willing to buy it, is it really worth that?\nIf we can, we must attempt to find a resolution to this issue.  Capitalism has led to an immense improvement in society and massive production.  It would be foolish to throw the baby out with the bathwater.  The selfish motivation of capitalism can be very productive for society if we can find a way for labor to be balanced in the equation of wealth.\nTherefore:\nMoney must be able to buy Capital. The tendency for capital to concentrated must be overcome.\n\nCapital can be broken down into Artificial Capital (ACP) and Real Capital (RCP).

Land can be bounded in two dimensions and it can produce rents.\nA tractor is another real piece of capital.  It can be used to produce crops or improve land.\nPatents can also be real capital.\nPotentially, encrypted digital assets could be considered real capital.  This is up for debate and it may depend on the type of digital asset that is produced.  For example, a domain name may be real capital while a digital share of stock may not be.\nThe difference of real capital and artificial capital will be discussed more in the ACP artificial capital chapter.\nThe characteristic of real capital that we want to focus on is that all forms of real capital degrade over time. Land must be invested in and made better.  Patents expire.  Tractors rust.\nTherefore:\nSome capital must be recognized as Real Capital and treated differently than artificial capital.\n\nOwnership of real capital can be recorded in a Public Ledger (PLG).\n\n\\newpage\n"},"the_pattern_language/acp_artifical_capital.html":{"url":"the_pattern_language/acp_artifical_capital.html","title":"ACP.

If too many people have too much money and demand skyrockets, how can inflation be prevented? If salaries crash and no one has any cash, how can prices be kept from deflating?\nCurrent money is a 'store of value'.  If you have a dollar today.  Bury it for 10 years. And then dig it up. You still have a dollar.\nYour only enemy is inflation. Your only friend, deflation.  It is very unlikely that you will be able to buy the same amount with that dollar in 10 years.\nIf one buried a bushel of wheat, would you expect it to be worth the same in 10 years when it is rotted?\nEven gold decays on an atomic scale. And gold is worthless for all but petty or highly scientific things.\nAll things wither and die.  And so we believe that our money must do so as well.  Now the good news is that things full of life also grow and reproduce.  Do not despair that our money will die.  It will also thrive.\nWe propose to control inflation/deflation with Demurrage.  Proposed by Silvio Gesell in the 19th century, Demurrage is a process by which a unit of currency 'decays.'  The rate at which it decays can be manipulated as to encourage the liquidity and flow of money through the economic piston.  If inflation is too high, the demurrage value can be lowered and people will be more encouraged to carry cash balances.  If deflation threatens, the demurrage rate can be increased to dissuade people from holding cash.  They will look to use it to buy capital and things that maintain value.  This will also lead to less waste.\nAs a hard example, let's say that the demurrage rate is 1% per year.  At the end of each month the owner of a dollar would have to purchase a .01 dollar stamp and affix it to the dollar to maintain its value.  If the owner does not want to pay the tax, he should spend the dollar before the tax is due. If she is wise she will spend it on something that may return her a dollar or more's worth of value in the future.  This is the idea of stamped money and it is not practical in our digital age, but the concept can be extrapolate out to digital currency.\nTherefore:\nInflation and deflation must be controlled with demurrage.\n\nDemurrage can provide solutions to taxation (TAX) and must be balanced with Interdependence and/or nth order decision making (INT).\n\n\\newpage\n"},"the_pattern_language/state_leve.html":{"url":"the_pattern_language/state_leve.html","title":"State Level","keywords":"","body":"State Level\nThe following patterns operate at the state level and help to maintain the sovereignty of the state.\n"},"the_pattern_language/sta_the_state.html":{"url":"the_pattern_language/sta_the_state.html","title":"STA.

Some of these states hold massive power and some are weak.\nWe don't pretend to have the answer to which 'size' a state should be but we do contend that it needs to exist.\nWe can say that should not be one global state.\nWe can also say that it would be inconvenient for the laws of the land to change every time you crossed a street so a state should not be the size of a city block.\nSomewhere in between is the answer and if one take the idea of wholeness, it is likely that the answer of the size of a state is dependent on the states around it, and the geography, and the makeup of the organizations of its citizens.\nSo if size is variable, what is constant?  The state is helpful for the organizing of a people into a coherent group so that they can govern themselves.  By creating a state with a constitution that protects the rights of citizens, order and human dignity can both be maintained.\nThe state can issue laws and help standardize society on certain protocols and language for transacting business.  We will discuss these later.\nOn the subject of ideology, I would like to try to avoid picking a side.  The citizens of the state must decide for themselves what form of government to take.  History provides many lessons about the evils of Imperialism, Capitalism, Democracy, Communism, Socialism, etc.  Our hope here is to create a form of money that would moderate those evils in all scenarios.\nIt is also worth noting that the future of the state may be multi-leveled and abstract.  Today in America we have National, State, County, and City governments.  All levels must currently be in agreement and the lower levels cannot override laws and rights granted at higher levels.  This is currently geographically based, but that is not a requirement.

This will not work and those currencies will be plagued with nefarious uses.\nWithout the rule of law, a citizen can refuse a form of payment for a debt or for goods and services.\nIn addition, theft often has no recourse in classic cryptocurrency schemes. If cash is stolen and moved from one wallet to another by unlawful means, there is no way, other than force and torture to move the money back.  By integrating rule of law into our scheme for a new form of money we will allow the state to right wrongs.\nWhat of state corruption and misuse of the rule of law?  This is a hard question to answer as the threat of overwhelming force has been the cause of many unjust acts by the state.  Our money must provide a way for the citizens to keep the government accountable.  The citizens must be the administer of rule of law on the government.

Not always, but in order to balance the amount of money in circulation and the production of an economy, money will need to be issued when production increases.\nOne issue that we currently have is that the fed tries to predict the amount of money that will be needed and adjust reserve rates and fed borrowing rates to affect the number of loans being issued.  In a sense they are trying to predict what will happen.  This is a foolish operation and has gotten us in trouble more than once.  Can we determine a way to issue currency so that is a direct function of production instead of predictive?\nWhat about when production falls?  How is money removed.  This is discussed in the chapter on Demurrage.\nTherefore:\nThere must be a way to issue money.

If we already have a method of money being taken out of circulation, it should be easy to pull more and have it make a stop in the government coffers to be spent on services. Money in government coffer that is not spent can demurrage to nothing over time.  This give the government a way to permanently take money out of circulation.\nThis Demurrage tax would be a 'flat tax' and would not be progressive.  It would hit rich and poor alike.\nThe taxation of artificial capital is hard.  Some artificial instruments do not provide for divisibility.  Rule of Law can be used to enforce the divisibility of artificial capital.  In this instance, the government can easily tax it by taking a portion each year.  This would be a much more progressive tax than a straight demurrage tax.\nWe can also consider demurraging artificial capital that is divisible and recorded in the public ledger.  This would allow for the flat tax of artificial capital. Because artificial capital will be divisible this will overcome the problem where an asset cannot be sold because a market does not exist for it.  In this case, a portion of the asset could flow through the system and the receiver could hold it until a market did exist for it.\nMost real capital cannot be divided so it cannot be treated in the same way.\nTherefore:\nProvide for simplified taxation of money and artificial capital.\n\nTaxation can help predistribute economic rents (PRF).

Neutralization of Economic Rent","keywords":"","body":"ECR. Neutralization of Economic Rent\n... How can a market (MKT) neutralize its inefficiencies.\nEconomic rent occurs when a market is inefficient.  How can they be neutralized?\nFirst we must understand Economic Rent: (from wikipedia)\n*\nIn economics, economic rent is any payment to a factor of production in excess of the cost needed to bring that factor into production. In classical economics, Economic rent is any payment made (including imputed value) or benefit received for non-produced inputs such as location (land) and for assets formed by creating official privilege over natural opportunities (e.g., patents). In neoclassical economics, economic rent also includes income gained by beneficiaries of other contrived exclusivity, such as labor guilds and unofficial corruption.\nEconomic rent should not be confused with producer surplus, or normal profit, both of which involve productive human action. Economic rent is also independent of opportunity cost, unlike economic profit, where opportunity cost is an essential component. Economic rent should be viewed as unearned revenue, whereas economic profit is a narrower term describing a more theoretical concept of unearned surplus income greater than the next best risk-adjusted alternative. Unlike economic profit, economic rent cannot be eliminated by competition, since all value from natural resources and locations yield economic rent.\nIn regard to labor, economic rent can be created by the existence of guilds or labor unions (e.g., higher pay for workers, where political action creates a scarcity of such workers). For a produced commodity, economic rent may also be due to the legal ownership of a patent (a politically enforced right to the use of a process or ingredient). For operating licenses, it is the cost of permits and licenses that are politically controlled as to their number, regardless of the competence and willingness of those who wish to compete in the area being licensed. For most other production, including agriculture and extraction, economic rent is due to a scarcity of natural resources (e.g., land, oil, or minerals). When economic rent is privatized, the recipient of economic rent is referred to as a rentier.*\nSo are economic rents 'bad'?  Capitalists seek every advantage to get them.  Unions lobby and organize so they can collect them.\nIt is hard to say whether they are good are bad, but what they are is 'unearned revenue'.  If they are unearned, where do they come from? Are they theft if they are unearned?  This would certainly make them 'bad'.\nI don't know that we can answer the question with any certainty, but what we can do is attempt to neutralize them.\nTraditionally, economic rents have been taxed if they can be isolated, or fees have been charged for the rights to put oneself in the position to earn them.\nWe will contend there is a better way. Who is harmed in the case of an economic rent?  The buyer of the good or services has to give up more than they 'should' have to if a circumstantial situation did not exist.\nOur proposal is not 'refund' the economic rent, or to tax the economic rent, but to put the payer of the economic rent in a position to participate in any future gain made from the economic rent.\nOur money should allow for this.\nTherefore:\nProvide for the neutralization of economic rents.\n\nThe neutralization of economic rent can be accomplished with the predistribution of economic rent (PRF).\n\n\\newpage\n"},"the_pattern_language/noc_negation_of_opportunity_costs.html":{"url":"the_pattern_language/noc_negation_of_opportunity_costs.html","title":"NOC.

How does a market (MKT) make choices between alternatives.\nMarkets make decisions based on the profit of the thing they are giving up. Is this the best choice?\nI am an economic novice.  It seems to me that what I'm about to propose may violate some fundamental principle of economics, but I'm going to throw it out there so that others that really understand this can comment.  Be forewarned. The following may be gibberish.\nOpportunity costs are: (from wikipedia)\n*In microeconomic theory, the opportunity cost of a choice is the value of the best alternative forgone, in a situation in which a choice needs to be made between several mutually exclusive alternatives given limited resources. Assuming the best choice is made, it is the \"cost\" incurred by not enjoying the benefit that would be had by taking the second best choice available.\nIf I understand this correctly, the opportunity costs are a key driver in our decision making. It seems to me that this is generally a point A to point B decision making process and that it completely ignores the Interdependence of things.*\nAll generated value is future generated value.  An investment in one thing may lead down the line to incredible profit, but for the initial investor, all may be lost.\nCan we negate this effect?  What if we could invest with significantly less opportunity costs given up?  Would this lead to extravagance and waste?  Would it lead to poor decisions?\nI'm not so sure.  If the bank were to give me 10 million dollars today, I would create some economic value with it.  Even if I squandered it on consumables, the producers of those consumables would thrive and go on to create economic value elsewhere.  What if the bank could participate in that future economic payout, even if I go bust?\nTo look at it another way, If Choice A Pays $10, and Choice B pays $20, our opportunity cost is $10.  What if A produces more economic value in the reuse of the capital invested?  Currently we cannot track this without significant contractual agreement(and beyond 1 or 2 iterations it would be nearly impossible).  But what if our money did this for us?  What if it was built into the system.\nWhat if we drastically screwed up the idea of opportunity costs.  I've used the word negation because I think it is possible that we could drastically change the conversation from opportunity costs to future economic potential.\nOur money should do this.\nWe take pull requests.\nTherefore:\nOur money should change the way a market views opportunity costs.\n\nNegation of opportunity costs can be accomplished with the predistribution of economic rents (PRF)\n\n\\newpage\n"},"the_pattern_language/pds_predistribution_of_super_profits.html":{"url":"the_pattern_language/pds_predistribution_of_super_profits.html","title":"PRF. Predistribution of economic rent","keywords":"","body":"PRF. Predistribution of economic rents\n... How can a market neutralize economic rent (ECR) and negate opportunity costs (NOC).\nMarkets can never be perfect, how do we account for unearned income?\nTo overcome the effect of economic rent our money will give preferred stock in an account to anyone that transfers money into an account.  We call these Prefs.\nAs an example, A father goes to buy a gallon of milk from the grocery store.  The gallon costs $2.  He transfers $2 to the grocery store account.  The grocery store give the man a gallon of milk and two shares of Prefs in the grocery store's account.\nWhen the Grocery store's account demurrages, a portion of the demurrage will go back to the man's account.  In this way, if he paid an economic rent of $.02 cents because the store was closer to home, he will make up the economic rent overtime.\nThe man may owe only a very small percentage of the prefs in the account, but eventually, cash will be returned to him.  We will discuss and analyze the flow of cash in this way later when we prove out that this works in our financial models.\nModern digital money allows us to do this.  Paper dollars would never be able to give us this functionality.\nLet us look at the effect of this transfer of prefs to the man:\n\nThe man may eventually recoup his payment of an economic rent.\nThe man is now 'invested' in the success of the store.  The better the store does, the sooner he will recover his economic rent.\nThe man has dispensed with $2 that he would have to pay demurrage on if he had not spent it.  He likely would have spent it quickly anyway to avoid this charge, so he benefits from delaying his pay back of the economic rent to the future.\n\nLet us take a look at it from the view of the store:\n\nThe store had to give up a piece of preferred stock.  This is a piece of artificial capital and cost the store nothing to produce.\nThe store's cash was going to demurrage anyway, it is agnostic to the receivers of the demurrage.\nThe adverse effect to the store is that if it holds the man's cash forever, it will eventually all demurrage away. This is highly unlikely.\n\nWe call this a 'predistribution' because the store's account must 'demurrage' all of its holdings in the account before it can accept another payment or pay cash out of the account.  We call this the 'catch up'.  All accounts must 'catch up' before they:\n\nReceive Pref payments from the demurrage of other accounts\nPay cash to another account.\nWhenever dictated by the rule of law.  We suggest at least monthly.\n\nTherefore:\nGive preferred stock to anyone who sends money to an account.  Pay a portion of the demurrage of that account out to the holders of prefs in that stock on a regular basis.\n\nThe predistribution of economic rent leads to the diminishing value of future economic rent  (DER) and is made possible with the public ledger (PLG). Control the recursive nature of predistribution of economic rents using the Principle of First Pref Payment (PFP).

Do you ever see him pursue an old woman? Rarely. When we do, we see it as off putting.  The same when a young woman pursues an older man.  Often this is the genesis of tumult and divorce.  There is something regal about a couple on their 60th wedding anniversary. There is a natural wholeness to fidelity and to the generations clinging to each other as we move through life.  We are born, we grow old together, and then we die to make room for the generation behind us.\nThis is the effect that I expect predistribution of economic rent to have.  The longer an account is around the harder it will become for it to attract new contributors. On the other hand, the contributors that have been around a while will collectively continue to support the account and look for future economic rents.\nI expect many will 'date' the account, find a nice spot to settle down and then continue to live with their commitment until the end.  Til death do you part.\nI guess in a sense I'm speaking about the love of corporations.  This is a very odd thing for me to say as I generally feel the opposite way.  But this is a new kind of corporation. One that must ramp up its contribution to the relationship with customers as the pref count goes up.\nOf course the opposite will be true as well.  What happens when the corporation has a significant(maybe close to 100%) stake in the account of a 30 year old worker that has been with the company for 10 years?  Is it more profitable for the company to keep the worker in their job or to do everything they can to help that worker capture economic rents outside of the corporation?\nI believe we will see a new dedication of the corporation to the labor where the corporation receives a significant rebate on the wages they pay labors by helping educate the laborer and push them to more profitable enterprises.\nTherefore:\nExpect the diminishing value of economic rent over the life of an account and provide for that life cycle.\n\nDiminishing value of future economic rents will lead to Corporate Death (KIL) and to the Enrichment of Labor (LBR).\n\n\\newpage\n"},"the_pattern_language/ins_instant_transfer.html":{"url":"the_pattern_language/ins_instant_transfer.html","title":"INS.

These individual investors were not willing to take on all the risk involved in the operation. They were fine risking some of their fortune on the venture, but were not willing to risk their entire fortune and livelihood if something were to go wrong.  This resulted in the forming of the first Limited Liability Charters.\nWe will speak to the efficacy of this choice in the chapter on Limited Risk.\nThe original charters were for limited lengths of time.  They ended and either had to be renewed or expire.  We no longer have this restriction and as we have spoken of in other chapters, 'immortality' is not a natural feature. It leads to concentrated power and abuse of that power.  We must do what we can to neutralize the power of this artificial construction.\nFor now we will grant that our system of money should allow for legal entities. Our system will allow anyone, to create a legal entity account in the system for any reason.  The underlying rules of who owns the account will be handled by rule of law.\nThe forming of corporations generally results in the production of artificial capital. The distribution and concentration of this artificial capital can lead to income imbalances if not controlled.\nIt could be possible to add a layer that allows a group of citizen accounts to submit cash to an account in exchange for common-voting stock in the account, but this system may be outside the scope of our project.\nOne key distinction is that although legal entity accounts will look like regular accounts, they will be different.  We would like to propose that Legal Entity accounts not have the right to private payment and dispersal.  We may want to support the exchange of funds that are undiscovered for a time period but then unlock in case there are sensitive issues at hand, but those should be determined by rule of law.  Legal Entities are not citizens should not be allowed to hide activity from the general public.  They are given protected rights and should be held accountable.\nTherefore:\nAllow for the creation of legal entity accounts, but do not give them the same rights as citizen accounts.\n\nLegal Entities can be held accountable by citizens (CTZ). They should be marked for death at some time in the future (KIL). They should move from concepts of limited liability to limited risk (LMR).  They should be encouraged to enrich labor (LBR).

What can be done about this.\nPlease keep in mind that we are speaking of Corporate Death and not Death TO the Corporation. Two very different things.\nCorporations have clearly demonstrated their effectiveness in generating massive value for society.  Our concern is their size and the length of their lives.\nAs we have discussed in the diminishing value of economic rents chapter, the accumulation of prefs and the predistribution of economic rents will give an advantage to areas of new business risk. New accounts will be a more attractive place to put capital.\nOnce a high number of prefs have been accumulated for a Legal Entity company, their future economic rents on capital will need to continually increase to keep money flowing into the corporation.  If a younger corporation can produce the same widget for the same price, the money will flow more to the younger entity because it will provide a higher prefs percentage.\nIn this way, there will reach a point where it is wise for a corporation to sell its assets and distribute the cash to shareholders because attracting new business will be too hard.  What about the prefs owned by the corporation?  If the company ceases to exist, what happens to the pref payments made to the old entity?  We have two options:\n\nAllow the account to continue to exist and prefs just pass through to pref owners.  Accounts such as this can be labeled as 'passthrough' accounts and not be taxed.\n\nDistribute the owned prefs proportionally to the pref owners.  This will result in heavy fracturing of prefs.\n\n\nThe first is probably the easiest to implement and straightforward for accounting.\nWhat about the business owners that put up the initial capital.  Doesn't this punish them and take value away from those taking the risk. It is our opinion that this should be the payment that is given for the privilege of limited liability and limited risk that they enjoy from the system.  The buyers of their goods have also taken on a portion of risk in entrusting their cash to the company.\nWe believe that it is likely that many schemes will be figured out for the orderly transfer of assets from an old corporate structure to a new structure.  We do not recommend annihilation, only the orderly transfer of power from old to young that we see in nature that allows for the general evolution of stronger and better fit to the environment.\nIn addition, stockholders can hold on to stock and issue distributions from pref payments received from the earnings of labor at new companies.\nTherefore:\nAllow for and plan for the death of each corporation.

How can the idea of limited liability legal entity (LGE) be made more natural.\nLimited liability is granted, in our society, without discretion and lead to a lack of 'skin in the game' where corporations can extract short term profits without having to be held accountable for long term effects.\nWhile admitting that there are valid and positive reasons for some limited liability, it is our opinion that this has lead to a significant lack of 'skin in the game.'  In 2014 one may need limited liability to send a private mission to mars, but one probably does not need it to produce fast food hamburgers.\nLimited Liability Corporations and other limited liability entities have a positive effect on society when they allow citizens to undertake more risk that the member would be willing to take on themselves.  This has led to massive amounts of good in our world.  Recently we have seen a trend of bad actors taking risks inside of LLCs, reaping huge profits and bonuses, and then walking away without a scratch.\nIs there a way that we can reduce the risk an entrepreneur takes but also require him to bear the long term risk of their decisions?\nWe believe that pref will help do this and that limited liability can be balanced with responsible decision making about the future.\nHow will this work?  Let's say an investor puts money into a company to start it.  He is one of a few investors and as his money goes into the account he receives some of the initial prefs as well as a portion of the common stock.\nIn a traditional LLC only his common stock is at risk.  If the company fails, creditors can take his common stock but cannot take anything beyond that.  They cannot take his personal fortune.\nWhat about the prefs he owns in the company?  According to an idea of statutory theft that we will discuss later, he cannot have his prefs taken from him.  Is the trade of not having your prefs taken worth forfeiting Limited Liability?  We will need to study this.\nLet's say this company fails and the owner has his common stock and family fortune confiscated to pay back creditors.  He will be bankrupt, but will have his prefs.  The prefs he owns continue to work. When his payments of his liabilities go into the company and out to the creditors, he gains more economic pref power.  His fortune is wiped out, but he will not be destitute.\nWe propose that new form of bankruptcy be enacted by rule of law that allows for all assets owned to be confiscated to pay off creditors but then a line is drawn at a point in time where the citizen is able to begin rebuilding their wealth via the pref payments they receive.\nWill this risk the public investment in common stock that has driven the rapid rise of public stock companies?  Yes, most likely.  One will be far less likely to buy a share of Exxon at $98 if they are actually risking significantly more than that because limited liability no longer exists.\nHow will companies raise money then?

The battle has spawned the failed experiment of communism and in the new century we see an increasing rift between the income of capitalists and labor.\nHow can we mitigate this?\nWe are against employment.  There is little to be gained in one person doing the same 'job' for 40 years.  We will contend that there is a difference between 'jobs' and 'crafts'.  A job can and is increasingly being automated by technology.  Crafts tend to require a human understanding of culture and problem solving that computers have yet to achieve.\nCraftsmen produce their art and capitalists take the lion's share of the profits.  How do we mitigate this?  Here again, prefs add a layer of responsibility to a relationship.  We motivate the capitalist by allowing that any unit of currency paid to labor has the ability to be returned via pref payments if the employee's earning power can be increased over his life.\nIn this way, capital will have an new desire to enrich labor.  Suddenly, capital cares about the health, education, and long term earning potential of a craftsman.\nWe think this will stabilized the war between labor and capital.  We may even see capitalists sponsoring the unions so that they can better understand and serve the needs of labor.  We will see a revival of the apprenticeship system where training is an integrated activity to work instead of a 2 week ordeal to be endured once a year.\nTherefore:\nCreate ways for capital to enrich labor and recover their labor costs.\n\nEnrich labor will help increase education (EDU) in the adult years of life.\n\n\\newpage\n"},"the_pattern_language/citizen_level.html":{"url":"the_pattern_language/citizen_level.html","title":"Citizen Level","keywords":"","body":"Citizen Level\nThe following patterns concern the citizen and his rights and responsibilities.\n"},"the_pattern_language/ctz_the_citizen.html":{"url":"the_pattern_language/ctz_the_citizen.html","title":"CTZ.

Without the citizen and the citizen's intrinsic, natural value, there is no need for money or an economic piston.\nWho are citizens? Anyone human being that is alive and breathing natural air.  This is the simplest to agree upon and most will agree that at least all that are in this grouping are citizens.  There are fringe areas where we can get mired in debate like the unborn and the brain dead on respirators.\nThe citizen is the center that we build this entire framework on. Our goal is to maintain the human dignity of all humans whether they have access to wealth or not and give all humans the right to begin, at any point, to participate in our economic piston without baggage.\nWe believe in a democratic system where each citizen has one vote.  If a child is not of voting age yet, their parents should wield their vote.  If society is concerned that some are not 'educated' enough to vote, this is a problem of society.  Educate them. Do not take their vote away.\nWe need to establish and protect the rights of citizens above the rights of the state or the legal entity.\nLet us explore the idea of a citizen a little more closely.  I'm a citizen of the United States, Texas, and Houston.  I have other things that I'm a member of and get a 'vote' in.  Am I a citizen of those things? Should I be? If I am a citizen of the United States, can I also be a citizen of France?  What if I want to be both?

This should be set at some reasonable level to bring in enough expenditures to pay for state operations and human dignity programs.\nWhat of local governments, unions, and other organizations?  The collection of dues could be handled through demurrage taxes as well.  For these types of citizenship, the user would have to elect their payment of these taxes. The organization would be responsible for providing the rights and benefits of membership.\nFor example, say the United States nationalizes our new currency and charges and demurrage tax of 25%. In addition they cap, via rule of law, state taxes at 10%, and county taxes at 1.5% and city taxes at 1.5%.\nTexas might compete with other states for business by only requiring 6%.  Houston and Austin may compete for citizens by offering lower than 1.5%.\nWhat if I want benefits of being both a citizen of Texas and New York?  I could elect to have a second citizenship.  I will have more of my pref payments go to taxes, but I will procure more benefits. In addition, a union could require a demurrage tax percentage of 1% to be a member of union.  There could be other requirements as well so it will need to be a mutual system where both the citizen and the organization agree that the member is a citizen.\nWe believe that the ease of collection of funds via this manner will entice organizations and states to subject themselves to the democratic veto that will be discussed later.\nWe will speak more to the powers that citizenship achieves later when we talk about Democratic Veto.\nWhat about non resident accounts?  Can a foreigner hold an account on our system?  Yes.  These accounts will be issued by the issuer and will not have citizen rights but may establish demurrage amounts by rule of law.

With the power of the public ledger (PLG) how can a (CTZ) ensure he receives the full output of his labor?\nCapitalism has to date allowed the capitalist to take value produced by the laborer as economic rent?  Can this be neutralized?\nThe idea of the 'full output of labor' has traditionally been a communist and/or socialist ideal. Is it exclusive to those modes of government?  Communism has failed and socialism loses many advantages of free market capitalism.  Can we have both the free market and provide a laborer with the full output of his labor?\nSurely providing a laborer with his full output is an admirable thing.  The 'working' class has always been one of the most disadvantaged and it would be admirable for us to lift the lower class out of poverty and give them the ability to reach their full productivity.\nWe believe we can do this.  First we must discuss our theory of value.\nWhat is the value of a man's labor?  This is a time bound question.  At the time of a person's hiring, the value is what someone is willing to pay him.  After he has labored, he may have produced something of far more value, but there was risk involved so the capitalist needed to make profit on the risk taking.  Surely we can allow the capitalist this right?  We can pay him for his risk with the profits of the labor.  We think this is optimal and drives capitalism forward.\nWhat of the laborer? Has he lost out on value?  Yes.  All he has is the cash he exchanged his labor for.  At a moment in time, that value is bounded by a number.  If we remove the time constraint though, his cash has significant value in the future economy.\nOur belief is that all value is future value.  Past value cannot be retrieved.  Once the labor is spent, it is gone.  You cannot renegotiate the value of the past labor. What you can do is track and capture the value that the cash paid to the laborer generates, and return it to him over time.\nIn addition since the capitalist owns prefs in the laborer, he will contribute future value to the laborer in hopes to increase his future income and recover his capital.  We assume the following inequality:\nValue of Labor At the time of Labor \nIn this way, the communist and socialist thinkers were thinking TOO SMALL.  The worker does not have the right to the full value of his labor, he has the right to the full future value of his past labor which is much greater.\nTherefore:\nImplement prefs to provide workers with the full output of their future labor over time.\n\nThe full output of labor can help contribute to a citizens Legacy (LEG).

How can the concept of limited risk (LMR) still provide for funding of capital ventures?\nBank bubbles and crashes have wrecked massive suffering on humans over the last hundreds of years.  Can we do away with this institution?\nBankers are vampires.  They take our money, risk it, and reap the profits.  They are stealing our output and lining their pockets with it.  We should do away with the current banking institution.  The amount of human capital and productivity that is lost trying to gain a small advantage while moving money around will be looked back on in the future with disdain and horror.  They are stealing from all of us.\nThe fractional reserve banking system does have some features that we would like to borrow, but we propose that the dividends of these advantages go to the citizens and not to the bankers.\nWe propose another lever available to the issuer of currency.  This is the reserve requirement for lending of our money.  All accounts will be able to have a portion of their cash 'protected' from demurrage.  This portion will go into a pool of cash that will be made available for loans.  This pool will be multiplied by another lever, called the 'Issuance Rate' which will allow the issuer to increase the money supply.\nFor example.  Say a citizen has $100.  The reserve rate is 90%.  The issuance rate is 20%.  The citizen will have 10% of his funds automatically moved into his 'bank' partition, and it will be protected from demurrage.  In addition, the loan pool will now have $12 available for loan.\nWhat will the interest rate and terms of these loans be?  We expect rates to trend toward zero for short term loans. If Silvio Gesell's theory of demurrage is correct, the charging of interest for loans should be unnecessary.\nIf money is 'free' won't there be a run on the bank for it?  Won't the market bid up the cost of this money so that interest is required?\nWe propose that 'Bankers' bid cash for the right to distribute the issued money.  Why would they bid cash if they won't receive interest?  Because they will get prefs in the account they direct the money to.  In this way, bankers only make money when the economic piston is firing and new capital is being generated.\nBecause we have instant transfer, and the cash system is centralized, we do not need to worry about 'bank runs.'  Cash going out of one account will go into another.  The reserve rate will allow the amount available for lending to remain in proportion to the reserve and issuance requirements.\nIssuers should use the levers of demurrage, reserve rate, and issuance rate to keep inflation flat.\nThrough this system, citizens and legal entities will earn a return on their borrowed out funds equal to the demurrage rate.  They will have professionals managing the loaning out of the cash.\nTherefore:\nRemove the commercial banking system and replace it with citizens automatically funding the issuance of loans from a general pool.\n\n\n\\newpage\n"},"the_pattern_language/sth_statutory_theft.html":{"url":"the_pattern_language/sth_statutory_theft.html","title":"STH.

How can we prevent the devaluation of predistribution of economic rents (PRF).\nAs soon as someone has collected artificial capital in the form of prefs, others will scheme to take the future value from those not wise enough to understand the value of their capital.  How can we protect these people? How can we prevent accounts from exchanging value simply to devalue the prefs of other owners?\nVia rule of law we will need to create a crime similar to statutory rape that outlaws the taking of prefs, or the proceeds of prefs from a citizen.  Should this apply to entities as well?  Yes, through a chain, the prefs paid to entities have value to the citizens that have supported the entity.\nHow will this work?  This is a complicated issue and will need to be dealt with carefully.  This is what we want to avoid:\nA mother spends money to raise her children.  She accumulates a massive number of prefs over 20 years.  A 'banker' offers to buy the output of her prefs for $100,000.  All of her value is future value and the prefs are probabilistically worth more than that.  This person is trying to take advantage of the mother's vulnerability.\nThe value of a pref is only bounded by the lifetime of an account.  Therefore the theoretical value is infinite.  Anyone trying to claim that value for a value less than infinite is stealing and should be held accountable by rule of law.\nIn addition, the exchanging of cash between accounts simply for the increase in prefs that it brings should be punishable via rule of law.  This includes passing money in a circular motion among a small group inside of a market.  This type of behavior reduces the value of the prefs of other owners and should be considered theft.  The public ledger can be used to compare prices paid in situations where this kind of activity is suspected\nTherefore:\nImplement laws punishing the underpayment to accounts for the rights to their prefs and passing of money where unfair value is exchanged and reduces the value of other prefs in the account.\n\n\n\\newpage\n"},"the_pattern_language/pri_privacy_and_private_dispersal.html":{"url":"the_pattern_language/pri_privacy_and_private_dispersal.html","title":"PRI.

How can we balance the public ledger (PLG) with a citizens (CTZ) right to privacy and also bar a legal entity (LGE) from the same right?\nIndividuals sometimes need to make financial transactions that are private and therefore will not want the destination of the payment to be registered on the public ledger.\nThe ability to pay into a 'privacy' account and have the output appear in the proper receiving account should be developed.\nPrefs will still be issued but they will 'pass through' the privacy account and be distributed to participants in that account.  The account should be big enough so that individual payments cannot be 'found out' via inspection.  Payments may split into many increments and be distributed over time. The receiver will be provided with a promise of payment.\nIt may be possible to tax this right to privacy if it becomes a method of activity detrimental to the general welfare.\nLegal Entities should be able to receive payments from these pools, but not pay money out to them.\nCitizens can send funds privately, what about receiving them?  If the funds are received from another citizen they should be allowed to be private, but payments coming from legal entities should always be public.\nOne issue that will arise is that a citizen receiving many payments via private pools may become inherently suspect as to their activity.\nJust because these items are private does not mean that they are not subject to rule of law.  If evidence is provided that someone participated in illegal activities, they are still subject to the law. Regardless, the flow of the transaction should still be 'undecodeable.'  The evidence will have to come from outside the money system.\nTherefore:\nImplement a privacy pool that allows citizens to make payments and receive payment(but only from other citizens when receiving) that are 'anonymous.'\n\n\n\\newpage\n"},"the_pattern_language/dig_human_dignity.html":{"url":"the_pattern_language/dig_human_dignity.html","title":"DIG.

Teachers are some of the lowest paid professionals in our society and they are in charge of ensuring our future. Can we overcome this?\nWe propose the public ledger be used to enrich teachers.  How will this work?\nAs children attend school, each child will be allocated a set of prefs.  This amount will be chosen by rule of law, but let us take an example.  Let's suppose that a high school education is worth about $1.5 million dollars in lifetime earnings.  if we divide this by 18 (0yo - 12th grade, including pre-school) we are left with about 83k per year of school. The state can put on the public ledger via rule of law an amount equal to 83k prefs in the account of each school, these can be distributed to the teachers in that school in accordance with the school's policies.  As a result, when a citizen graduates from high school, his former teachers will collectively own about 1.5 million prefs in that citizen.  If he holds $2000 in his account for a month at a 12% demurrage rate, and the tax rate is 50% (quite high), each year of teachers will receive about about $2 to distribute among themselves.  With a large number of students and a long teaching career, these dividends could become quite healthy.\nWe expect that many more people will want to start their careers as teachers and build up a large amount of prefs before moving on to higher careers.\nIn addition, the propensity to send young graduates off to war for indiscriminate reasons will be reduced if a significant portion of the population his such a substantial investment in the young people being successful.\nTherefore:\nIn addition to paying teachers well, the state should give prefs in the citizens they teach to teachers as a dividend for teaching.\n\n\n\\newpage\n"},"the_pattern_language/eld_eldercare.html":{"url":"the_pattern_language/eld_eldercare.html","title":"ELD.

We want to make it clear here the the House is dependent on those geographic states.\n\nand the Electors in each state shall have the Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most numerous Branch of the Geographic State's Legislature.\nEach representative shall be limited to three regular elected terms in office after which they will be ineligible to serve in the House of Representatives.\n\nTerm limits for congress. Finally. With 350 million people in our country we can surly find a few hundred new ones each 6 years to represent us.\n\nNo Person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained to the Age of twenty five Years, and shall have been four Years a Citizen of the state, and who shall, when elected, be an Geographically Elected Inhabitant of that State in which they shall be chosen.\n\nHere we've added a more stringent residency requirement for representatives to try to reduce carpetbagging professional politicians.\n\nRepresentatives must not have received private payments of cash or private allotments of capital for one year before taking office unless elected or assigned for a vacancy. Representatives must elect to not receive private payments while in office and for ten years after leaving office.\n\nPrivate payments are feature of the catallaxian economy where private citizens can engage in commerce that is still on the public ledger but not traceable to  the citizens that engage in that commerce.  One may want this feature if you are paying for a sensitive medical procedure or any number of other things that you don't want your neighbors to know about.  This section prohibits those that want to run for congress from engaging in that kind of activity for  a year before they are elected(while they are running for office) and for 10 years after leaving office.  Serving in this position should be a privilege and grants privileges that come with significant responsibilities.  This feature does not prohibit them from making private payments, just from receiving them.\n\nThe Number of Representatives shall number at least 400. The number of Representatives from each State shall not exceed the number of Geographically Elected Inhabitant of that state divided by the whole count of Accounted Citizens divided by 500, but each State shall have at Least one Representative, and until such enumeration shall be made, the States shall have the following allotment:\n\nThis formula keeps the house at a reasonable size even if the republic grows.\n\nThe actual Enumeration shall be made within three Years after the first Meeting of the Congress, and within every subsequent Term of ten Years.\n\nEstablishes a 10 year period for re-allocating the number of seats in the House.\n\nWhen vacancies happen in the Representation from any State, the Executive Authority thereof shall assign a temporary representative until a special ranked choice vote of the affected subdistrict is completed to elect a new member.\n\nThis allows for a governor of a state to assign a temporary rep if someone dies or leaves office.\nThis is also the first mention of ranked choice voting and subdistricts so we might as well talk about them here.\nRanked choice voting coupled with subdistricts should give us a more parliamentary form of representation in the house.  Later we call for subdistricts to be created in states with more than 3 reps and these should be selected by electing from a slate of voters and ranking your choice for office from one to X.  In a 3 rep sub district, the top 3 vote receivers are selected.\nI give a lot of credence to David Deutsch’s argument that a two party, first past the post system is preferable if we want a dynamic system where progress is made.  The intention of this system is not so much to ensure a 3rd party seats in congress, as that artificially inflates the power of the 3rd party, but to balance out representation in a 2 party state where typically 3 districts would go to the dominant party even though the opposition received 45% of the vote.  Restricting the districts to 3 reps should result in a 2/1 split in this scenario and should make things move even more dynamically.  A 3rd party would still have to reach a very high bar before they could capture one of the 3 seats.\nWith that being said, it may need to be reduced to 2 seats per sub district once the mathematicians get involved and explain how this won’t work.  It may also be that a programmatic drawing of districts will resolve most of the problems and that multi-seat districts won’t be necessary.\nRanked choice voting is laid out more in Right XX of Article VII:\n\nRight XX\nA citizen shall, when voting for elected office, have the opportunity to rank choices for office in such a way that if their higher choice is eliminated from competition via an instant runoff, their next choice shall receive their vote; and shall be allowed to specify candidates for which they wish to never have their vote cast for such that if all preferred candidates are eliminated, their vote may be cast for no one. This right shall extend to all elections at any level of public government.\n\nIn the case of a multi-seat election, your top 3 votes count and if one of your top 3 are eliminated from competition, you 4th choice is activated as a vote and so on down your list.\n\nThe House of Representatives shall choose their Speaker and other Officers; and shall have the sole Power of Impeachment.\nSection. 3.\nThe Senate shall be composed of Senators from each State; Three senators from states with total geographically elected inhabitants greater than 1/50th of the total Accounted Citizenship, Two senators from states with total geographically elected inhabitants greater than 1/500th and less than 1/50th of the total Accounted Citizenship, and 1 Senator from states with total geographically elected inhabitants less than 1/500th of the total Accounted Citizenship.\n\nThis calculation maintains some of the 'equal representation' concepts of the senate, but applies a common sense order of magnitude exception. If you have more than 1/50th of the population in your state, you get three senators.  If your state is less than 1/50th of the whole population you drop to 2 senators.  If you are less than 1/500th you only get one senator.  This will keep very small states from trying to join the republic.\nAccording to current populations only Vermont and Wyoming have a sparse enough population to drop to 1 Senator.\n\nThe actual Enumeration shall be made within three Years after the first Meeting of the Congress, and within every subsequent Term of ten Years.\nSenators will be chosen for a term of six Years.\nEach Senator shall have one Vote.\nSenators may serve one regular elected terms in office after which they will be ineligible to serve in the Senate.\n\nTerm limits and senators never have to run for re-election.\n\nImmediately after they shall be assembled in Consequence of the first Election, they shall be divided as equally as may be into three Classes. The Seats of the Senators of the first Class shall be vacated at the Expiration of the second Year, of the second Class at the Expiration of the fourth Year, and of the third Class at the Expiration of the sixth Year, so that one third may be chosen every second Year. And any initial senator whose term is shortened may be elected to a second term.\n\nNo change other than allowing initial senator's who elect to serve shorter terms the right being re-elected once.\n\nWhen vacancies happen from any State, the Executive Authority thereof shall assign a temporary representative until a special ranked choice vote of the affected state is completed to elect a new member.\n\nHere we institutionalize ranked choice voting for special election of senators.\n\nNo Person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty Years, and been three Years a geographically elected Citizen of the State for which they will be chosen.\n\nThe big change here is that you must have had a geographic election inside the state for three years or more.  This is to reduce the carpetbagging situation where a powerful person cherry picks a state to run in.\n\nSenators must not have received private payments of cash or private allotments of capital for one year before taking office unless elected or assigned for a vacancy. Representatives must elect to not receive private payments or allotments while in office and for ten years after leaving office.\n\nThis reinforces the restriction of private payment to those that would like to serve in the Senate.  The restriction is lifted on the front end when there is an unexpected vacancy, but the general understanding is that you should know you are running for the Senate for at least a year before you take office and take the steps necessary to block private payments from your account.\n\nThe Vice President of the Executive Branch shall be President of the Senate, but shall have no Vote, unless they be equally divided.\nThe Senate shall choose their other Officers, and also a President pro tempore, in the Absence of the Vice President, or when he shall exercise the Office of President of the Executive Branch.\nThe Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the Executive Branch is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present.\nJudgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under this Constitution: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.\nSection. 4.\nElections for Senators and Representatives shall be open for a period of 3 months prior to the election closing and shall conclude 3 months before the beginning of a new term.\n\nThe intention here is to limit the period of active campaigning to a 3 month period.\n\nSenators and Representatives shall be chosen by ranked choice election by the inhabitants of the State for which they are a candidate.\n\nThis establishes the ranked choice voting scheme for the House and Senate.  The concept is the same for the senate except that only one senator is chosen at a time.  This can still encourage third party candidates by giving citizens the ability to vote for a fringe candidate first and then major party candidate 2nd so that their vote will still count when the third party is eliminated.  On the other hand, enough people doing the same may eliminate the main candidates and elevate an outsider.\n\nStates in which elect more than 3 representatives will have their State sectioned into smaller subdistrict for elections by programmatic geographic algorithm that proceeds in allocations of five miles squared from the North West corner of the territory and moving East, then south until the proportional number of geographically elected citizens is reached. Neither Congress, nor state legislatures my alter the allotment of subdistrict for any reason or in any way unless this constitution is amended.\n\nThis clause eliminates gerrymandering.  By dividing subdistricts by algorithm we reduce the ability for state governments to collude to take control of the house by splitting districts to neutralize a minority vote.\n\nNo subdistrict shall elect more than 3 representatives.\n\nLimits subdistricts to 3 members.  This is important because you want to keep representation fairly local.  A large state may seek to have very large subdistricts to try to convince the candidates to act more like Senators since they need the approval of the larger district.\n\nThe Congress shall assemble at least once in every Year, and such Meeting shall be on the second Monday in January, unless they shall by Law appoint a different Day.\nSection. 5.\nEach House shall be the Judge of the Elections, Returns and Qualifications of its own Members, and a Majority of each shall constitute a Quorum to do Business; but a smaller Number may adjourn from day to day, and may be authorized to compel the Attendance of absent Members, in such Manner, and under such Penalties as each House may provide.\nAttendance and submission of votes may be virtual if the representative is participating while physically located in their home district, so that representatives may attend to their constituents. But representatives must attend at least 3/4 of active sessions at the seat of government or be subject to expulsion by procedure in their elected house or replacement by the state's executive.\n\nThis clause allows for remote voting and remote participation in the house and senate so that members may spend more time locally. It also gives each house and the state governments a method to remove absentee representatives.\n\nEach House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings, punish its Members for disorderly Behaviour, and, with the Concurrence of two thirds, expel a Member.\nEach House shall keep a Journal of its Proceedings published on a Blockchain, and published in as near real time as technology will allow, excepting such Parts as may in their Judgment require Secrecy and then must be entered as encrypted to be unlocked after no more than 7 years; and the Yeas and Nays of the Members of either House on any question shall be entered on the Journal.\n\nThis clause implements the filing of opinion, proceedings, and votes into the blockchain so that the public record cannot be fudged.  In addition it calls for the proceedings of proceeding dealing with national security to be encrypted for no more than 7 years, upon which, the proceedings become public.\n\nNeither House, during the Session of Congress, shall, without the Consent of the other, adjourn for more than three days.\nSection. 6.\nThe Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the congress.\n\nAny increase in pay or benefits for either house must not take effect until all current members have reached their term limits._\nNo change here except to codify the amendment limiting reps from giving themselves raises.  Since term limits are now a thing we can limit the raise to going into effect until all current members are gone.  In this scenario a raise in the senate or house would not be able to go into effect for six years after it is enacted.\n\nSenators and representatives shall in all Cases, except Treason, Felony and Breach of the Peace, be privileged from Arrest during their Attendance at the Session of their respective Houses, and in going to and returning from the same; and for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other Place.\nNo Senator or Representative shall, during the Time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil Office under the Authority of this constitution, which shall have been created, or the Emoluments whereof shall have been increased during such time; and no Person holding any Office under this constitution, shall be a Member of either House during his Continuance in Office.\nSection. 7.\nAll Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills.\nEvery Bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a Law, be presented to the People for a period of three weeks during which the vote of each representative may be subject to review and override as prescribed in Right XVII of Article VII of this constitution. Then President of the Executive Branch; If she approve she shall sign it, but if not she shall return it, with his Objections to that House in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the Objections at large on their Blockchain, and proceed to reconsider it. If after such Reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the Bill, it shall be sent, together with the Objections, to the other House, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two thirds of that House, it shall again be submitted to the people for review and override and with such, if a 2/3 majority remain in favor, become a Law. But in all such Cases the Votes of both Houses shall be determined by yeas and Nays, and the Names of the Persons voting for and against the Bill shall be entered on the Blockchain of each House respectively. If any Bill shall not be returned by the President within ten Days after it shall have been presented to him, the Same shall be a Law, in like Manner as if he had signed it, unless the Congress by their Adjournment prevent its Return, in which Case it shall not be a Law.\n\nThis is fairly standard to the original except the additions about adding proceedings to the blockchain and the inclusion of the people's veto.  Before a vote can be registered, the people have the ability to veto it.  This is described more in the Right XVII of Article VII.\n\nEvery Order, Resolution, or Vote to which the Concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary (except on a question of Adjournment) shall be presented to the President of the United States; and before the Same shall take Effect, shall be approved by her, or being disapproved by her, shall be repassed by two thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives, according to the Rules and Limitations prescribed in the Case of a Bill.\nAll bills must be specific and on point of a single issue, with no amendment from tangential issues attached. All sections of a bill must have a direct and clear correlation to other sections and all must adhere to the subject of the bill as declared in the preamble. The Executive may line item veto articles, sections or subsections that do not meet the direct and clear standard and if signed, the whole bill, excluding those sections shall become law. Congress may supersede any line item veto by passing a separate resolution including those vetoed sections as a separate Bill by a 2/3 majority of both houses.\n\nThis removes the ability of congress to pass omnibus bills that have riders on them that have no bearing on the core of the bill.  This also gives the President line item veto power if he feels that an item is not core to the bill.  There will certainly be disagreements that will need to be resolved via the courts.  Congress has the ability to override these vetoes in the same way they would override the veto of an entire bill.\n\nSection. 8.\nThe Congress shall have Power To create electable taxes, Duties and Imposts and Excises.\nTaxes shall be limited to:\n\nWe are going to restrict what congress can do a little bit differently than the original constitution. Things are a bit more split out and we are going to talk about taxation a bit first. Below we specifically outline what can be taxed.\n\nThe demurrage of cash from accounts, citizen and corporate, to accounted citizen.\n\nCongress can tax the amount flowing from an corporate or citizen account to a citizen account via our catallaxian system.  The possible amount that can be taxed can be easily calculated by multiplying the money supply by the demurrage rate.  Congress would not want to tax this amount at a high rate, but may want to raise some revenues this way.\n\nThe demurrage of cash from corporate accounts to other corporate accounts. The tax rate on corporate demurrage may not be lower than the tax rate on accounted citizen demurrage.\n\nFlows to corporations can also be taxed and we outline here that that rate cannot be lower than the tax on citizens.\n\nThe demurrage of artificial capital to the commons such that the demurrage is offered up for public bid for a period of at least two weeks and that the demurred from entity shall have the right to pay a tax equal to the highest bid to retain the rights granted by the capital else the tax may be collected from the highest bidder. If there is no bid for the artificial capital its ownership shall remain with the state and must be submitted for rebid after no more than one year.\n\nThis is a wealth tax on artificial capital.  In exchange for limited liability corporations must put their shares on the blockchain and their shares must be subject to decay back to the commons.  They have the right to buy these decayed shares back if they are willing to match and pay the highest bidded amount.  This should likely end up being the main vehicle of taxation.\n\nCongress shall lay no tax on the income of accounted citizens but may tax incomes of corporate entities whose owners enjoy limited liability.\n\nOutlaws income tax on individuals but allows it on corporations.\n\nCongress shall lay no tax on the forgiveness of debts issued to accounted citizens via blockchained and demurraging cash.\n\nThis outlaws the taxation of the forgiveness of debt.  Remember that in our catallaxian system, many loans may turn into investments if the demurrage income starts to look more attractive than the loan repayment.  We want to encourage that.\n\nAll donations to corporate accounts representing religious institutions shall be taxed as income and may not be ununiform from other corporate levies.\n\nOutlaws religious tax breaks because why do we have these in the first place?\n\nExcises shall be limited to:\n\nExcises are like specific taxes on things...like sin taxes on cigarettes or alcohol.\n\nActivities and goods which reduce the availability of the commons to future use. Including but not limited to, carbon emissions, extraction of minerals, spoilage of water, or the destruction of land.\n\nInstitutes environmental taxes.\n\nActivities and goods by which humans may reduce their length or quality of life.\n\nInstitutes destructive health taxes.\n\nDuties and Imposts may not be levied on goods or services moving amongst geographically elected territories, but may be levied on goods and services imported from foreign nations.\n\nOutlaws taxes on goods flowing from state to state.  This will encourage a free trade society as more and more territories elect into the constitution.\n\nThe revenues generated must be allocated by congress to:\n\nThis is an important section because if give congress the set of powers that outlines what it actually does.\n\nTo pay the debts and provide for the common defence and general welfare; but all Excises shall be uniform throughout the geographically elected area, the seas, and outer space that accounted citizens may reach.\n\nWe are throwing outer space into the mix, because the future.\n\nTo borrow Money on the credit of the government;\nTo regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States;\nTo establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization, and uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the elected territories;\nTo coin Money via a blockchain, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin, and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures;\nTo provide for the Punishment of counterfeiting and hacking the Securities and Coin of the Government;\n\nWe implement the right to coin money, but only via the blockchain, and to enforce the integrity of the currency via rule of law.\n\nTo establish Post Offices and post Roads;\n\nWe still need these things...or at least the right to do them.\n\nTo establish off-world colonies, both on worlds and as space stations, and regulate the trade routes amongst them, to preserve the long term existence of the human race.\n\nExplicit power to make our civilization a multi-world civilization.\n\nTo promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries such that the grant of rights adheres to the following set of restrictions: no grant of rights shall be extended beyond its original grant. Exclusive Patents on Technologies must include a material component. Patents that do not contain a material component and software patents must be open patents. Patents of technology shall not exceed 21 years and if it is found that upholding the patent shall endanger the life or healthfulness of any citizen than it shall be declared an open patent by the courts. The use of open patents by citizens and non-limited liability entities shall not be infringed. Any limited liability corporation wishing to use an open patents may do so by negotiating the rights with the patent holder or by providing common stock of the corporation wanting to use the technology to the patent awardee valued at equal to the cost of developing the technology as declared by the patent holder in the patent. Copyrights on images, texts, films, renderings, and other such creative arts shall not exceed 50 years.\nCongress shall make no law extending or circumventing patent and copyright limits except by proposing an amendment to this constitution via the prescribed method in Article X. Patents rights and Copyright rights shall not be transferred from one citizen to another except that citizens may leave patent rights to heirs upon death. Corporations may only transfer patent rights upon blockchain bankruptcy or wholesale purchase of the corporation. No corporation shall be granted a patent whose sole or majority business is the holding and enforcing of patents. Corporations may not hold copyright but must pass the copyright either directly to the citizens responsible for the production of the art or a class of all citizens who have relieved a payment for employment or services for the time period during which the art was created. And the right to rescind assignment of copyright or patent rights from the original filers shall not be restricted.\n\nThere is a bunch here.  The intent is to update and modernize our copyright and patent systems.\nFirst we establish that patents and copyright cannot be extended once granted.  If the original term is 7 years, congress can't extend it in year 6 for another 7 years.\nWe then speak to what kind of patents there can be.  We propose two kinds. Exclusive patents are the kind of patents we have today where the owner can restrict the use of the technology during the patent period.  The second is an open patent that give the owner the right to the economic benefit of the patents but allows the open use of the patent by citizens and non-limited liability entities.  Limited liability entities can gain access by providing a set of common stock equal to the cost of the patent.  This requires that open patents provide the cost of development when filed and if the cost is not-realistic the patent office should reject the patent.  This still provides large corporations from competition undercutting them by using the patent.  Small corporations will sometimes not be worth the cost of the patent in their entirety.  This is by design as we do want some protection for patents.\nWe also specifically outline that medical patents are to be open patents if it can be demonstrated that keeping the patent exclusive will be to the detriment of well-being.\nWe limit patents to a maximum 21 years in length so that innovation can flourish.\nWe limit copyright to 50 years as congress has increased it far to long in its current state.  We do not extend it to the 'life of the author' because we are hoping that becomes less of an issue and we hope that the 50 year limit will allow for authors to benefit from their works and then release the work for the culture to mix and annotate.\nWe disallow congress from changing any of the stated rules by any means but amending the constitution.\nOne major change is that we don't allow for the transfer of a patent or a copyright.  One can assign the rights temporarily but cannot sign away the rights permanently.  Copyrights that are still in the 50 year period can pass from citizens to their heirs.  Let's take a quick look at how this would work for Disney making a movie.  Disney would file a copyright in the names of either: the originator of the work(hard to pinpoint for such a large project) or a class of citizens that worked on the film.  They would likely use the second.  All employees working for the corporation that produced the film would be in this class and can make decisions about the copyright rights by voting.  They can assign the rights to the copyright, including the ability to charge royalties and give distribution rights, to the corporation temporarily, but not permanently.  If the class votes to withdraw the rights from the corporation, they can do so.  The goal of this is to push the benefit down to the citizens actually producing the work.  Disney cannot just fire all the animators after the film is produced because they will vote to reclaim their rights to the film.  If they want to release the animators they are going to have to negotiate with the class to pass some of the royalties down to be distributed to the class that was formed when the copyright was filed.\nFinally we outlaw patent shops that just try to file patents to make money.\n\nTo constitute Tribunals inferior to the supreme Court;\nTo define and punish Piracies and Felonies committed on the high Seas and in outer space, and Offences against the Law of Nations;\nTo declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal, and make Rules concerning Captures on Land, Water, and outer space;\nTo raise and support Armies, but no Appropriation of Money to that Use shall be for a longer Term than two Years;\nTo provide and maintain a Navy, but no Appropriation of Money to that Use shall be for a longer Term than two Years;\nTo provide and maintain an Air and Space Force, but no Appropriation of Money to that Use shall be for a longer Term than two Years;\nTo provide and maintain a Civilian Space Program that explores reachable space.\nTo make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land, naval, air, and space Forces;\n\nThe only major change here that we include outer space in the mix and establish the right to fund NASA into the constitution.\n\nTo provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions;\nTo provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the Government, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress;\nTo exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever, over such District (not exceeding ten Miles square) as may, by Cession of particular States, and the Acceptance of Congress, become the Seat of the Government. But this district shall not allow for any accounted citizen or corporation to geographically elect inside the district such that no citizen may be disenfranchised and no corporation shall escape taxation and so that the district shall not need a separate government.\n\nThis is a little bit of a change from the current Washington DC clause in that we don't allow this district to have citizens.  Citizens will need to have their geographic elections outside of this district.\n\nTo exercise Authority over all Places purchased by the Consent of the Legislature of the States for the Erection of Forts, Magazines, Arsenals, dock-Yards, space stations, and other needful Buildings;\n\nNo change except space stations.\n\nTo create an agency for the oversight, maintaining of fairness, and protection of citizens in lending, banking, and finance.\n\nPuts the SEC and consumer finance protection bureaus into the constitution.\n\nTo create an agency for oversight of campaign finance laws so that fairness and the integrity of national and state elections shall be maintained.\n\nTasks congress with the obligation to maintain fair elections and to legislate campaign finance laws so that Citizens United can't be called free speech.\n\nAnd Finally,\nTo make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government, or in any Department or Officer thereof.\nSection. 9.\nThe Migration of such Persons as any of the States shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited or taxed by the Congress.\nThe Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.\nNo Bill of Attainder or ex post facto Law shall be passed.\nNo Tax or Duty shall be laid on Articles exported from any State.\nNo Preference shall be given by any Regulation of Commerce or Revenue to the Ports of one State over those of another: nor shall Vessels bound to, or from, one State, be obliged to enter, clear, or pay Duties in another.\nNo Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law; and a regular Statement and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time to time.\nAny information collected by the government with the use of money from the Treasury shall be collected in a way that it may be easily made available to any requesting accounted citizen in as small a time frame as technology shall reasonably allow.\n\nThis institutes open data laws and makes any information collected and modified by the government open for public download.\n\nNo Title of Nobility shall be granted by the Government: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, Payment in Kind, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, Foreign State or Foreign Corporate Entity. And Congress must enforce the separation of such Officers in the Executive, Ledgislative, and Judicial branches from any opportunity to profit from business dealings while the officer serves such that non-compliance will result in impeachment of the officer.\n\nThis has been updated with Payment in Kind to deal with situations that arise when a President, Representative, or Judge will not divest themselves of their business dealings.  We also give congress the ability to enforce the divestiture or risk impeachment.\n\nThe power of the congress to create electable taxes on citizens and mandatory taxes on corporations and artificial capital, shall be non-exclusive and congress shall not deny the rights of states, jurisdictions, cross-state organizations, or other entities to create and collect electable taxes such that all collections and dispersions of funds into those accounts are open for public inspection and that no private payments are made to or from such accounts.\n\nThis establishes the catallaxian system of electable taxes as well as allowing for state, local, and other forms of organizations to act as pseudo-states inside the republic as long as the adhere to the same open and no private payment laws.  All tax collection and expenditure must be listed on a public ledger and be open for inspection.\n\nSection. 10.\n\nNo Change\n\nSection 11.\nRepresentative, Senator, or Executive shall only raise cash for the purposes of running a campaign except by the requesting the election of tax on demurrage by accounted citizens that shall be capped on a per citizen basis such that the integrity of the officials are maintained and no one set of citizens may hold more sway over said officials, except that congress may allow for the matching of elected funds with public funds from the treasury in uniform proportion and without regard to political party or agenda.\n\nInstitutes the public funding of election at all levels of government and allows for congress to match these funds. This was borrowed from somewhere and I can't find the original source.\n\n"},"a_new_constitution/article-ii---commentary.html":{"url":"a_new_constitution/article-ii---commentary.html","title":"Article II - Commentary","keywords":"","body":"Article II - Commentary\nThis section discusses the roles and responsibilities of the executive branch of government\nArticle.

Residents may elect a non-descript location for their privacy but must reside within 10 mile of that location for at least 10 days a year and the Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.\n\nThe above defines what a 'citizen' is under this constitution.\n\nNo State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\n\nRequires that the rights given to citizens in one state apply in other states.\n\nSection 2.\nRepresentatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of accounted citizens who have geographically elected inside the state bounds.\n\nGives citizens the right of 'no taxation without representation' in the house.\n\nSection 3.\nNo person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.\n\nThe confederacy amendment.\n\nSection 4.\nThe validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned. But neither the United States nor any State shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States.\n\nMore civil war amendments.\n\nSection 5.\nThe Congress shall have the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.\n\nGives congress the power to enforce and legislate the rights given in this article.\n\nSection 6.\nCitizens of the United States shall have the following rights:\n\nOur bill of rights!\n\nRight I\nCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; nor shall they make any law to give benefit to a religious organization that is more advantageous or disadvantageous of any corporation.\n\nHere we remove the power of congress to give special rights to religious groups but also protect their establishment and practice.\n\nNor shall congress or the government of an state make any law based on the tenets of any religion unless said law has grounds in demonstrateable evidence as applied within scientific inquiry or a foundation in the common law.\n\nHere we outlaw religious based law such as sharia or old testament style theocracy.  This would eliminate the ability of states to make 'Blue' laws of or for states with muslim majority populations to institute any kind of sharia law and gives citizens of those states the grounds to challenge those laws.\n\nAnd any such law shall be void unless it alleviates the suffering of citizens and honours the inviolable sanctity of every single human being, treating everybody, without exception, with absolute justice, equity and respect.\n\nOutlaws laws that treat men, women, and gender diverse people differently.\n\nAnd any such law shall be void if it impoverishes, exploits or denies basic rights to anybody or incites hatred by denigrating others—even our enemies.\n\nThe core of these rights came from somewhere I can't find, but a few google searches should feret it out.

Citizens shall have the right to call upon the militia for protection if threatened by any organized group of such size as personal protection is beyond reasonable means. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation and to define military grade as time and technology requires.\n\nMaintains the reasonable right to bear arms and gives congress the right to legislate the definition of 'military grade'.  This is common sense gun control and preservation of the right to bear arms to protect oneself against 'individuals who would do violence'.  If defence beyond individuals is necessary the matter should be elevated to a well regulated militia.\n\nRight V\nNo Soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without the consent of the Owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by law.\nRight VI\nThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, effects, and communication pathways, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\nRight VII\nNo person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation as determined by open auction.\nRight VIII\nIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\nRigth IX\nIn suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.\nRight X\nExcessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted, nor capital punishment inflicted.\n\nThe only change here is the outlawing of capital punishment.\n\nRight XI\nThe enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.\nRight XII\nThe powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people and their institutions.\nRight XIII\nNeither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.\nRight XIV\nThe right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, sex, gender identification, sexual orientation, genetic typing, or previous condition of servitude. The Congress shall have the power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.\n\nWe update and modernize this amendment to include gender identification, sexual orientation, or genetics.\n\nRight XV\nThe right of citizens of the United States to vote in any primary or other election for President or Vice President, for electors for President or Vice President, or for Senator or Representative in Congress, shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any State by reason of failure to pay any poll tax, other tax, artificial requirement, or political party affiliation. The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.\n\nWe update this to include the right to vote in any primary.\n\nRight XVI\nThe right of citizens of the United States, who are eighteen years of age or older, to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of age. The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.\nRight XVII\nCitizens of the respective states shall have the right to supersede any legislative vote made by their respective representatives by casting an override of 50% of geographically elected citizens from the respective territory. For such purposes an accounted citizen may delegate their vote another accounted citizen in the same geographic district on a one to one bases. And a citizen that has been delegated to may further delegate the sum of delegated votes delegated to them unto another delegate in the same geographic district.\n\nEstablishes a fourth check on power.  In this case the power of the legislature by the citizens.  This draws the focus of power back to the representative constituents by allowing them to delegate their override vote to other citizens and thus form loci of influence inside the states and districts.\n\nRight XVIII\nA woman shall not be deprived of her right to end the bearing of a child before the 25th week of gestation. After the 25th week of gestation, a child shall be granted full rights of a citizen under this constitution and no entity shall have the right to take its life save the mother in the following cases\nthe child will not live outside the womb with any quality of life.\nthe mother's life is endangered to an abnormal degree by continuing the pregnancy.\nthe mother is a minor under the age of 18.\nthe mother can demonstrate ignorance of the pregnancy before 25 weeks of gestation.\nthe pregnancy resulted from a unwanted sexual event and the mother was ignorant of the pregnancy before 25 weeks of gestation.\n\nThe freedom of choice amendment that makes the concession to outlaw late term abortions except in profoundly upsetting scenarios.\n\nRight XIX\nA citizen willing to enter into a trade or provide a service who forfeits all limits of liability and who publically makes known to all parties in a transaction their intent to practice without limited liability shall enjoy the right to practice without the regulation or restriction of any government, national or state; but must pay any levied excises, imposts, duties, or taxes levied on that trade or service as is consistent throughout the union. This right shall not extend to any partnership, group, corporation, or joint stock company.\n\nThe right of individual citizens to enter into commerce without state intervention or over regulation.  In order to take advantage of this right, one must forfeit any form of limited liability.\n\nRight XX\nA citizen shall, when voting for elected office, have the opportunity to rank choices for office in such a way that if their higher choice is eliminated from competition via an instant runoff, their next choice shall receive their vote; and shall be allowed to specify candidates for which they wish to never have their vote cast for such that if all preferred candidates are eliminated, their vote may be cast for no one. This right shall extend to all elections at any level of public government.\n\nThe right to ranked choice voting.\n\nSection 6.\nThe rights of citizens shall not fall to any corporation or joint stock company as formed by any state or authority, domestic or foreign.\n\nCorporations aren't people and do not enjoy these rights\n\nSection 7.\nCitizens shall have the rights to form partnerships, corporations, and joint stock companies and can own stock in such companies if the stock shall demurrage to the commons such that the demurrage is offered up for public bid and that the demurred from entity shall have the right to pay a tax equal to the highest bid to retain the rights granted by the capital.\n\nThis establishes the right to form limited liability corporations, but also institutes that the stock of said companies must be subject to a tax to the commons.\n\nBut such shall be subject to the following restrictions:\nRestriction I\nCorporations shall be able to receive private payments from accounted citizens but must make all outgoing payments public and open.\n\nCorporations can receive private payments, but all expenditures must be made on the public ledger.\n\nRestriction II\nNo limit of liability shall be extended to any corporation or partnership unless its ownership is subject to demurrage from the commons and that it elects the national tax at 0x384758.\n\nCorporations must pay the national tax.\n\nRestriction III\nCorporations shall not prescribe or request any employee, partner, or contractors to lobby the government on its behalf and Congress shall power to enforce this Restriction by appropriate legislation.\n\nLobbying the government is outlawed by corporations.\n\nRestriction IV\nCorporations shall at no time make any payment to a public official in power in the United States or any of its States while the official is in office.

Congress shall power to enforce this Restriction by appropriate legislation.\n\nGives congress the power to regulate crony capitalism and outlaws gross consulting of former government consultants.\n\nRestriction VI\nCongress shall make no law such that the demurrage of corporate accounts shall be less than that of national citizens, but it may be more.\n\nInstitutes that corporations must pay higher taxes than citizens on the demurrage of cash.\n\nSection 8.\nCitizens shall have the rights to form institutions by establishing an electable tax on demurrging cash and to fund the institution by the election of accounted citizens and corporations.

These entities are subject to the below restrictions and governments can take them over by choosing to fund their operation out of the public treasury.

Inside of this moral framework we see four major economies at work in our modern world.  By pulling our problems apart at the seams of these economies we can more morally address our world.\nUltimately we find that the universe is in the business of bootstraps.  Each economy that latches and takes hold has the possibility of having any number of additional economies built on top of it.  When one of these add-on economies is created, and latches, we say that the universe has bootstrapped an new economy.  These new economies operate on a fundamentally different system of supply and demand than their base economy and operate specifically to overcome the operations of the base economy.  The effects of these more advanced economies cause a fundamental breakdown of anticipated deterministic behavior of the universe.\nHumanity is separated from the rest of nature by having two biologically based systems in our brains that help us to operate in the cultural and intellectual economies at a very high level.  Since the enlightenment we have been operating at a high quality level in these two economies.  Our moral framework helps us envision a bootstrap from either of these two levels.  We have discussed how it is imperative that we bootstrap the societal level before the intellegence level with the hope that a super intelligence system would use available data to make important decisions about whether humanity has something to contribute to a new world that includes super intelligence.  We call this society bootstrap the supersociety.\nWe acknowledge that this new bootstrapped economy will have a moral authority over our existing societies and intellectual institutions. But, we aim for it to include elements of the intelligence bootstrap, namely the operation across time and the repeatability of phenomena across time, in this supersociety to achieve our goal of validating the reality that all sub systems should be acted toward with moral responsibility.\nUltimately we propose a new economic framework, the hypercatallaxian economy, to advance our goal.  This economic framework puts the citizen at center of the social economy and restores money to a natural state.  This new form of money moves faster and adapts to volatility in a positive way.  It also lays the foundation for a secure society where there is a balance between social provision and capitalistic economic drive.  The underlying econim institutions drive society to aplace where very long human life helps to stabilize and strengthen the economy.  This is truly our end goal as we hope to see a world where aging has been solved so that we can move toward further technology advancements that secure our minds from destruction.\nIn order to support this hypercatallaxian economic framework we propose some changes to the intellectual construct of the United States constitution.  These changes align the government with the our new economic framework.  They also increase the transparancy of how government activity is recorded and tracked.\nThis volume is a living document and the ideas we propose are not fixed in time.  As we move down the path and solve the problems in front of us we will discard what does not work and make new proposals for what will solve the problems that threaten our continued existence.\nPlease visit http://catallax.com to continue the journey.\n"}}}
