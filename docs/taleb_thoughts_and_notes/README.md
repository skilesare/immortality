# Taleb Thoughts and Notes

The economics at the biological level is an economics of fitness.  When we move to the social and intellectual, the economics are no longer ecomics of fitness.  They may map to fitness, may be a derivative or an integral of it, but it isn't fitness.  The societal is accumulation and market sustatinability.  The intellectual is learning and repetability...in a sense, correctness.  Fitness can promote wrongess if the timescale is wrong.

We avoid both economic historicism and randomness. Historicism says there is a law we can follow that defines the future...economic laws. Randomness is avoided by allowing the agent to pick its own point in the future and work toward it without fear of ruin. Under HC, success provides more upside than failure, and failure is not backbreaking. Thus we all become convex option seekers.

Banking is picking up pennies infront of a steam roller.  You hope to make enough interest off of your client before they blow up to  make a profit in the long run.  The problem is things blow up and the banking industry can lose more than it has made in the history of the world if a few things go the wrong way.

To flip things on its head, how can we drive a bull dozer over penny picker uppers?  Lets assume a economy and you are a banker.  You make loans of $100 a piece and you make 1 a day.  They have a default rate of x per day, a term of y years. To price each loan, you take the rate of default and extrapolate a price where you expect to make z%.  The rate of default will change accoording to a distribution H each such that H is black swanian.(your chance of default can't go below zero where as it can go up to gurenteed(100%).

Interst proceeds will be loaned out in a contienuous fashion

In addition the loan will be guranteed by an asset.  That asset will fluctuate in value based ona distribution A where some assets degrade to 0 and some increase in value.  We will seperate out different tyes of loans (unsecured, secured but depreciating and secured and appreciating, a mix)

We will expect that defaulting appreciated investments won't result in blow up because they can be sold for more than the outstanding loan amount.

We will see from this the likely inevitability of bankers blowing up.

We will then show the same scnario under a catallaxin economy where the loans are not only subject to the same security senarios, but the banker also sees a catallaxian return on the thansfer of cash from time t -> infinity

Proceeds will be re loaned.

We expect to see a significant reduction in blow up risk.

taleb notes

- Price formation is a function that is not linearly additive of the opinions of participants –but one that depends on the upper bound, as in evolutionary systems.
- Likewise scientific knowledge isn’t the product of the opinions of a council of car- dinals; it can only progress by consensus-busting –it would otherwise be frozen in time. So if all "experts" say risk management by VaR is OK except for one who says –and proves – that it isn’t OK, it doesn’t mean it is OK. One single argument rigorously formulated can but centuries of verbalistic opinions of experts.
- Social issues are from extreM istan
- Optionality as a replacement for intelligence - Hyeck missed it. He believed in a distributed intelligence.
- True or False isn't always what is important, it is the payoff that we get from each, and often they are imbalanced.
- Hc is banking with unlimited upside instead of unlimited downside.
- How do we make skin in the game have limited downside.
- Rank things in order of optionality
- 1/n approach
- Reverends of economics.
