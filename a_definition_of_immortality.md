# A definition of 'immortality'

When I speak of immortality I am speaking of a state of nature in which an intellegence has a reasonable expectation that it will continue to exist and operate, without defect or deteriorization, beyond a point in the future where technology can be expected to exist that can aliviate and heal any micro-defects.

##On Why death is bad

Death is the end of a mind.  Under our current knowlege, a mind is one of the most precious resources that we have.  There are a number of meta-physical postulations and religious opinions that expect a mind to continue after death, but there is zero physical evidence that this is so.

Of course many of us have faith that the mind endures beyond death, but we also are not in a hurry to test that hypothosis.  If a divine being is at odds with us preserving our minds, it is more than welcome to intervene.

##On Expectations

The immortality that I am addressing in this book is not a magical or spritual immortality.  It is unlikely that the minds that participate in this immortality will realize that they are in that state.  This is a result of approaching the state of immortality slowly.  The mind will live for a significant amount of time with the expectation that it will die around 100.  Then, after a time that expectation will will become 150.  Then when the mind is 200 it may only expect to live another 100 years.  At 350, 1000 may seem achaivable but not likely.  And so on.

##On Accidents

Many minds may still die.  This is due to the accident and physical forces outside the control of the minds.  A large galactic event may annihilate the entire area that minds inhabit and end this grand experament prematurely. Or if we are really unlucky, a plague on earth may end it in the next couple of decades.

##On Minds

What is a mind?  Currently it is this mass of neurons in our heads.  There may exist in the future a way to augment this mind or even transfer this mind to a much more robust medium.  In fact, extreamly long life may require this transfer take place many times over the course of the future.

##On Atoms

The possibility of this transfer is due to the fact that, at their core, atoms of particular elements are fungible.  That is, one carbon atom is completely indistinguishable from another.  Further the molecules that these atoms form, when positioned in 3D space in a similar manner, act the same.  On a much more complex level, if I were able to take make a 3D scan of your brain at the atomic level and reasemble it with a 3D printer, it would be the same mind.  It would have your memories.  The axons in brain 1 that had been streangthened would be strengthened in brain 2.

To go to a further technalogical step, if I'm able to crate a nano-device that simulates a neuron with fidelity and I'm able to arrange these simulated nurons in the same connections as your in your mind, this new mind would be the same mind.

Now having two minds that think they are on mind cause a another set of issues, but lets not get ahead of ourselves.

##On Immediate Hurdles

There are two immediate hurdles for humanity to get over to reach immortality and neither is that unimaginable.

The first is that we need to put a cap on the genetic code that causes our cells to age.  Many scienties expect this process to be mostly figure out soon.  We have already discovered that teleomere strings get shorter as cells divide and when they get short enough, cells stop regenerating.  By manipulating this string of genetic bits we may be able to drastically exend expected life spans.  A doubling of life spans at this point may be enough to get us to the life expectancy slope of 1 that we need to reach.

The second is that we need to diversify the space that we inhabit in the gallaxy.  First to Mars, and then beyond.

##On Macro-hurdles

Once these initial hurdles are achieved we will need to work on bigger problems like over comming accidents.  Prehaps by 'backing up' our minds. Then on to active back ups.  Etc.

##On the distant unseen

This is where I'll put my really crazy ideas like sending our duplicated minds into different light cones.  And on constructing zero-energy laticies for the reconstitution of minds upon another 'bang.'
