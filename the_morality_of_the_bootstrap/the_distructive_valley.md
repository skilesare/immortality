### The Destructive Valley

Morality invites conflict ridden conversation. Morality can easily oppress and that makes me fairly hesitant to use the word. We must discuss morality’s importance while also guarding against what I call the destructive valley. The destructive valley emerges when agents in one area, that have moral authority over a lower system, act without moral responsibility.

We can see some of the most obvious examples of this by looking at the socio-political happenings of the 20th century. After the amazing gains that science gave us during the industrial revolution, a number of political movements emerged that tried to leverage the moral authority of intellect over society to try to generate forms of 'utopia.' Suggesting that movements such as marxism and nazism had 'moral authority' over society has its unpleasantness, and yet we must recognize this truth. We ultimately rejected them because they lacked moral responsibility. How did they lack responsibility? They damaged the layers below them in the moral cascade that they had authority over to the point of destruction.

After a bootstrap reaches a certain point it becomes 'self aware' and realizes its power and authority over the lower levels. Unfortunately, in the next phase those agents use the lower levels 'at all costs.' And sometimes this phase accrues a very high costs..

We can highlight this tendency to have a destructive valley and plan for it. Even, perhaps, put a morality in place that insists on responsibility as opposed to just authority.

**Moral Responsibility > Moral Authority**

How do we define responsibility in this case? An agent with moral responsibility will understand its moral authority over lower cascade levels, and yet still make decisions that preserve and amplify wholeness at lower levels. The enlightenment has given us a secret weapon in this balancing act. We must realize that we can overcome our inability to balance with the right knowledge. We never have to resort to destructive authority unless we run out of time and face total annihilation.

As an example, the intellect has authority over the inorganic, and we could certainly make short term gains by stripping the valuable resources from our environment, but, if we maintain morally responsible, we will use the resource in renewable and responsible ways. Here we can arrange environmentalism in our framework as not forced on us by any authority, but demanded of us as a moral responsibility.

As we speak about future bootstraps, beware the destructive valley.

### Violence

The demands of moral responsibility override moral authority’s license to do violence to those in an inferior position. This applies in almost all but the most inescapable situations.

Restrict violence to situations where morally inferior systems deliberately attempt to undermine and destroy morally superior systems.

Consider a nationalistic government declaring war on an intellectually grounded civilization. Such a case warrants violent retaliation if the intellectual society has exhausted non-violent recourse or faces  imminent danger of destruction.
