# The bootstrap order

Now that we have looked at each level, lets summarize how the bootstrap occured and create a systematized layout of what our system looks like.

| | Inorganic (1) | Biological (4) | Societal (9) | Intellectual (13)
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Inorganic | forces(2) / patterned forces(3) | environment (6) / structure (7) | object creation (16) / art (19)| machinery (18) / industry(21)
| Biological | - | reproduction (5) / biodiversity (8) | grouping (11) / disbursement (12) | self preservation (15) / health(22)
| Socital | - | - | resources (10) / money (20) | culture (17) / diversity(23)
| Intellectual | - | - | - | time observation (14) / science - replayability (24)

The Inorganic(1) values Forces(2). Quality forces emerged in the form of pattenred forces(3) that bootstraped to the Biological(4).  The biological used a different value system based on Reproduction(5).  The biological began to seek environment(6) and realized that it could manipulate environment into a quality environment via structure(7).  The diffusion of biological life to various environaments and the ability to create multiple different strucures led to the bootstrap of bio-diversity(8).

This biodiversity eventually found a bootstrap via survival of the fittest to society(9).  This occured because organisms stumbled into an environment where working together allowed genes to survive from generation to generation.  These new societies valued resources(10) that they needed to maintain their organization.  Because resources were limited sociteis began to group(11).  As these groups sought more and more quality groupings they developed disbursement(12).  And the world was filled.

Along the way a second bootstrap from biology occured when biology discovered that observing what happened over the course of time was a quality way to gain fitness.  Intellegence(13) emerged.  This system valued time observation(14) and enabled entites to understand the concept of self preservation(15).  The ability to observe change over time enabled some animals to not just manipulate the environment via pattenred forces as had existed in structure, but now they could create objects(16) based on repeating and rearragned observable forces.  These objects led to culture(17) in humans(who had the most advanced brains) as humans sought to pass this knowlege on from one generation to the next. Some humans realized they could leverage inorganic material to create some of these cultural items and machenary(18) was born.  Machinary allowed some humans to pursue created objects that have a quality beyond utility and we call these items art(19).  The proliferation of goods causes humans to seek a quality exchange of goods that resulted in the creation of cash money(20) based markets.  Increased accesss to capital allowed us to pusue qulaity machinery resulting in industry(21).  Industry freed us to pursue a quality self preservation resulting in increased healthyness(22).  The ablity for all people to have a healty existence enabled us to envision multiple societies thriving leading to diversity(23).  Finally, a generally peaceful and healty planet frees us to purse quality time observation..aka science(24).

The order that items appear here is important and reveal quite a bit about the development of morality and value over time.  First lets take each pair and look at the value authority that is present in each.

pattenrned forces >(greater value authority) forces - an ordered universe...litteraly the fact that the seat your are sitting on doesn't drop you onto the floor relies on the fact that patterned forces can suppres unpatterend forces, or chaos.

structure > environment - structure creates and gives form to environment.

biodiversity > reproduction - the definition of survival of the fittest.  If you are more fit, you reproduce.  A biodiverse planet has more antifragility than a planet with just one species.

art > object creation - we value art more than general objects.  We really value beautiful things that are also useful.

disbursement > grouping - we don't all live in the same place for a reason.  It is a much more quality use of resources to spread out.

money > resources - Economists might refer to this as the liquidity premium.  Money has more value than resources because it can be exchanged for anything else more easily.

industry > machinary - Collusion, cooperation, vertical integration.  Call it what you want, but machines working together and in line produce more in less time.

health > self preservation - Self preservation allows you to live a long life but subject to inorganic and biologial forces, health allows us to supress thoes forces and live even longer

diversity > culture - your culture cannot surpress the diversity of others.  Call it political correctness if you like but I like to think of it as not being a jerk.

science > time observation - can you replay it?  If so it has more reliability and more value than if you observed a one time occurance.

We don't just learn about value authority, we also learn something about moral authority.  Each system level has moral authority over the one before it.  We don't bat an eye when biological systems supress and manipulate inorganic system.  For thousands of years human society didn't seem to bat an eye when a socital edict manipulated biology.  From the king's forest to capital punishment, we are only recenlty making some concessions that maybe we shouldn't give society free reign over biology...and that comes from our intellectual system observing the poor effects of some of our biological manipulations.  We are just now entering a time where we can reliably make intellectual edicts on the societal layer and many of these result in violent reactions from the societal layer.  This makes sense, of couse those that still operate mostly on the societal plane of existance don't want to be subject to an intellectual layer that they hardly understand, but it is morally so.  The intellectual has over come the societal and is more advanced.

Ideally the  intellectual should and can find a solution that least disrupts the levels below. That is the quality thing to do.  It is also the wise thing to do because the intellectual hasn't overcome the last obstical in this universe and it is likely that another bootstrap even more advanced is around the corner.  If intellectuals want to be respected in the future by system next, they should probaly set a good example now.
