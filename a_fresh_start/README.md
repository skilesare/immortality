#Introduction

## Preface

#### I. A fresh start

Let us live as man will live in the future and think as man will think in the future. To make any progress in this volume, you will have to set aside what has come before. We may have difficulty with this, but if we would like a fresh start at this grand life we must repeat this step continuously.

#### II. A philosophy

I do not have a scientific degree, yet this work will take a scientific tone. I hope to point us toward a worldview where those better trained in the scientific arts who have more time available to them than me will prove out the generalizations I propose. This book finds itself as a work of philosophy and I realize that others will prove many of the generalizations scientifically unsound. Those theories that fail scientific rigor will seek to point in a vector close to the real and I hope that those wiser than me can corrected them.

#### III. The great economies

We will conclude that life has a simpler mechanic than the initial complexity we see on its surface would imply. We live amongst four great economies and on the cusp of a million more. Robert Pirsig identified these in his works of [Zen and Motorcycle Maintenance](http://amzn.to/2lJyISc) and [Lila](http://amzn.to/2mpksLq). Pirsig identifies the four economies in Lila. We define these economies as the **inorganic**, the **biological**, the **societal**, and the **intellectual**. Pirsig does not call them economies, but as we move forward we will see an economic nature emerge. Lesser economies may emerge as well and perhaps even major ones that I do not pay enough heed to, but in thinking about the major issues that our world faces, these four seem worth our focus for now. We may find these economies do not fit well into discrete categories and instead form some kind of continuum that we cannot see easily. I will leave this possibility to others to investigate and treat the economies as discrete for the purpose of this book. I think many of the conclusions will stand even if a continuous evolution of one 'kind' of development emerges.

#### IV. The bootstrap

The four economies did not always exist. First the inorganic emerged after the universe cooled enough for a pattern of forces to cascade out of the primordial plasma. Millions, maybe billions, maybe trillions of years later, some of these forces arranged themselves in such a way to replicate themselves and overcome the prevailing economy of patterned forces.

This new economy did not deal in the supply and demand of patterned forces. Patterned forces bootstrapped a new economy that dealt in the supply and demand of reproductive fitness. We call this the biological level. The biological level often uses the inorganic level to its advantage to create a pattern of fitness. Take a nest: the organism leverages the forces created by the nest material(the ability to keep out unwanted forces such as weather, predators, and other deadly things) to increase the reproductive fitness of the organisms raised in the nest.

In addition to using the inorganic level, the biological level began to use its own economy to evolve itself into a more and more adept engine for reproduction. The organic level used knowledge stored in DNA to accomplish this.

A **bootstrap** occurs when a system produces a new economy that leverages the pre-existing economies to create a new and stable economy that itself can grow and change.

#### V. Two more bootstraps

The diaspora of what can develop balloons in new directions with each new bootstrap. In addition to the inorganic -> biological bootstrap, we also have the biological -> societal bootstrap and the biological -> intellectual.

The societal level builds on the inorganic and biological levels and deals in the economics of resources. This layer contains traditional economics as we know it in the 21st century. At some point, the biological stumbled into controlling resources in a way that increased its fitness for itself and for many additional generations. The original adaptation enabled collecting just enough to get through the winter. An economy that dealt in wealth and abundance emerged. Like an organism building a nest, an organism that builds a society protects itself from the need to evolve at the biological level. Society tends to slow down evolution because the organism can assure the survival of its genes by means other than biological adaptation. The knowledge for humans to excel in the economy of resources gets encoded in the memes that make up various aspects of our culture.

The intellectual level finds its foundation in the biological platform, but also has the advantage of bootstrapping after the societal level and thus has access to that infrastructure as well. The intellectual deals in an economy of time-shifted reproduction of phenomena. This phenomenon leads to science. We should not take the ability to anticipate the outcome of an action, and to trigger that action as a given. This development depends on the intellectual level developing. This ability generates things like language. When I shout 'Duck!' I expect to get a certain response from those around me. If I shout Duck! Quack, Quack! I will have an anticipation of what others will see in their heads in these two different circumstances. We accumulate the knowledge needed to excel at this level in symbols that we put down on paper or up into the internet.

#### VI. A god in the dust

Pirsig proposes a further concept called **Dynamic Quality** that he points to as the bleeding edge of reality as we cut through time. Pirsig lets Dynamic Quality lead where it will. I will choose to pass this dynamic quality through the lens of Christopher Alexander's Nature of Order and focus it not on a random wandering, but on a purpose-filled generation of **Wholeness**.

In this concept we find a god in the dust of everything, and not so much in the thing as in the relation of each thing to the other. In as much as a thing hangs together with the things around it, we can see this wholeness. When this wholeness presents itself, dynamic quality passes from a nebulous thing to a static quality. An entity emerges. Many entities emerge.

#### VII. Moral Authority

When we observe this pattern of the bootstrap, the timescales that we currently consider reasonable for the age of the universe, and the time taken for each bootstrap, we can make a generalization about the universe. **The universe is in the business of bootstraps.** Further, the universe demands a **moral imperative** of bootstraps occurring. Each new bootstrap advances and that advancement has an implicit moral authority over the existing economies used to reach this new bootstrap.

What right do I have to say that morality comes into it at all? This complicated question has few good answers. We take it as a presupposition at this time drawn from the fact that we, as human beings, result from three bootstraps. I will lean some on Alexander's theoretical proposal for the equation of wholeness here. When things become a thing, it is good and right and the world emerges.

The biological has the moral authority to attempt to overcome and even disrupt the patterned forces of the inorganic world. Society has the moral authority to disrupt biology and shape the inorganic for its gains. The intellectual has the authority to structure society, to manipulate the biological, and subdue the inorganic to create repeatable symbolic realities. This authority is real and it is **dangerous**.

#### VIII. Moral Responsibility

The fact that the biological system bootstrapped twice reveals a key fact about the universe that helps redeem the moral tyranny that moral authority can suggest. If society had completely subdued biology then the intellect would have never evolved. While society has authority over biology it also has the **moral responsibility** to provide for all the additional unpredictable bootstrapping that these systems may have.

Our approach to the future must recognize the authority but must act with responsibility because we cannot predict where the next great jump may occur.

Later we will explore some moral quandaries and show how this morality cascade gives a much more focused framework for making decisions in all things from what to have for breakfast to government policy.

#### IX. What comes next

We can make some assumptions from the bootstraps that have occurred about the bootstraps to come. Since we have seen bootstraps from the inorganic to biological, then the biological to the societal and intellectual, we now have four leaping off points for the future. Any of these points may become the 'next' form of economy that transforms our world.

#### X. Biology II

The inorganic took millions of years to bootstrap to the biological. We may have additional inorganic to X bootstraps in our future. We find two ways this could come about: the molecular storm or design. Biology originally fell out of the molecular storm producing self-replicating, carbon-based molecules. Other kinds of non-carbon self-replicating molecules, or at least, not DNA/RNA based may emerge.

Instead of waiting for the molecular storm to produce this bootstrap, we may see humans design this kind of bootstrap now that we can manipulate across time and 'do science.' In fact, we have an extensive amount of speculation in this area with nanotechnology and the ideas of making self-replicating machines that do not have a DNA base. I call this possibility Biology II. There may also emerge a biology III, IV, V and beyond. Any instance where patterned forces emerge into a stable economy that isn't survival of the fittest would count as a new bootstrap.

Dangers exist in these new economies such as the 'gray goo' scenario where a self-replicating thing just eats away at our reality. More likely, an emerging biology II, if engineered here in our environment, would leverage the existing infrastructure and incorporate our intelligence and society into the mix. It certainly would have the moral authority to do so. We should consider the question of whether it would have the moral responsibility to preserve the levels that had come before it.

#### XI. System III

Biology developed two bootstraps that operate on the control of resources and manipulation across time. We could see biology develop a third system that dominates our world. I consider this a most unlikely bootstrap in the near term as society and intellect operate together to create a rather reliable boundary around our existing biological situation. System III will likely not evolve until we reach out to the stars and a branch of humanity becomes so isolated, and potentially regresses to a state where evolution could gain back the upper hand.

On the other hand, designing a system that integrates with other technologies might force a local evolution. Consider a scenario where we can connect our minds to a centralized network and information flows instantly amongst all humans connected to that network. This could force a new kind of evolution based on pre-existing biases in our biology.

#### XII. Supersociety

Society operates on the control and efficient allocation of resources. What happens when we get so efficient at this that a new structure begins to form on top of this reality that develops its own economy beyond the allocation of resources. The supersociety will become the focus of this book I reach a conclusion that we have an imperative to make the supersociety the next bootstrap before we reach any of the other bootstraps if we are to have hope that the current iteration of humanity will continue on into the future, and achieve **immortality**.

#### XIII. Superintelligence

Contrary to popular belief, artificial intelligence(AI) will not constitute the next bootstrap. It may bring this bootstrap along faster, but in order for real superintelligence to emerge, it must make the manipulation across time and the reproduction of experimental results so effortless and common that a new economy based on something else entirely can emerge. I can't even comprehend what this looks likes, but I assume that entire simulated universes will pop in and out of existence in the same way that protons and electrons break and form chemical bonds.

Imagine a universe where you can send a thousand copies of yourself on a 10,000 year journey to discover something and that that 10,000 years only seems to pass in a second for you. After that second you have access to the vast array of knowledge that your copies amassed during that 10,000 years.

#### XIV. Bleeding Edges

Please do not try to divine the next bootstrap and then pursue that with reckless abandon. We cannot predict the bleeding edge of dynamic quality. Instead, we should attempt to increase the surface area at each point in each system so that dynamic quality can have its way and we can find the wholeness produced. This does not assume that every touch point with dynamic quality holds equal potential to bootstrap. In fact, some points will produce fragile economies, others robust, and finally, the ones that actually bootstrap will produce antifragile economies. Expect many false starts along the way.

#### XV. Latching

The production of new dynamic economies does not implicityly produce a bootstrap. We also need these economies to stick around. Economies should not only have a robust character, but also antifragile and stable. We will call these economies **antifragile-stable** to signify the importance of this latch. Without the latch a new economy will break down and cease to produce the possibilities of new bootstraps.

#### XVI. Toward supersociety

In this book I will focus on the bootstrap to the Supersociety. In a Supersociety, we overcome and render irrelevant the limitations of societal economics. If we want our current society to continue, this needs to happen in a way that moral responsibility integrates with moral authority. This will allow the eventual bootstrap to superintellegence to focus on not disrupting our society even though it has the authority to do so. We've had some practice at this with our intellectual bootstrap. Many of our advanced intellectual constructs that have had the most success have allowed us to maintain a diversity of societies inside of the time based intellectual construct.

To determine how to overcome the economics at the societal level, we must understand that economy. This economy consists of the supply and demand of resources. We have gotten very good at allocating resources and we have created many societal and intellectual institutions to try to streamline this process. Unfortunately, we haven't made it irrelevant yet. Making it irrelevant would require maximizing the efficiency of our use of resources. We've tried a few things through the years to try to do this, but most of our efforts have proven too fragile for reality. Currently, capitalism rules the day with its laissez-faire approach to markets. Even this hands-off approach has exposed itself as fragile. Communism probably took the grandest stab at this but was exposed as hyper-fragile.

I will propose to maximize the surface area of society by using the tools of the intellectual economy, namely the manipulation across time and observation. I wish we could predict the future and make the best decisions now, but the lack of time travel makes that impossible. We can reliably make decisions in the future based on what happens between now and then. Society has attempted some forms of this and contract law has found success in increasing the efficiency of our markets. Ultimately, though, the implementation of a rules-based public ledger that maximizes efficiencies will have the best results. Today we call this ledger the blockchain.

#### XVII. An Economic Vector of Time

Just adding blockchain does not achieve supersociety. When one considers the reality of the societal layer of our reality, one quickly realizes that time does not play a factor. Humans find it hard to separate time from our societal institutions because our intellectual natures. Consider the study of economics and the classic idea of 'Homo Economicus.' This concept assumes a theoretical entity making the best decision it can *with the knowledge it has on hand.* Economics doesn't allow for fudging time or for considering the completely unforeseen consequences of future time.

So we must also add into our public ledger a time-based vector of reality. In fact the blockchain allows us to replay time and make decisions now based on what really happened in the past. This is very different from making decisions about the present based on what the people who have the most power now say happened in the past. The blockchain keeps us honest in our replaying of the past.

#### XVIII. Hypercatallaxian Economy

To increase the surface area the most we need to maximize the number of antifragile-stable systems that can emerge. To do this I propose a type of economy that I call **hypercatallaxian**. The word 'catallaxy' derives from the Greek verb katalatto, which means 'to exchange,' or 'to become reconciled with,' or 'to admit into the community,' or,'to make an enemy a friend.'(wikipedia) Economists discuss catallaxy as an emergent property of market economies. We take these principles and build them into the economic system to amplify them, thus, hyper.

At its core, this economy occurs on a public ledger. As an account hods cash it begins to decay. This decay rate incentivises a person to use or convert the cash into a capital asset as quickly as possible. The cash does not decay into thin air. Instead it travels back through the blockchain to those that provided the cash in proportion to the amount provided into the account. This incentivises spenders to spend on accounts that they think will receive more cash in the future. We reward them if they predict success. Those that guess best receive a larger long term dividend than those that guess poorly.

The core economic question transfers from a question of what can I get for my dollar today to what can I get today and who will steward it best in the future.

Over time this economy provides a meritocratic based income to all participants in proportion to how well their contributions to the economy perform in the future.

Later we discuss many more details in the pattern language in the section Art and Democratic Hypercatallaxy.

#### XIX. Neutralizing Risk

Entrepreneurs across the planet look for these antifragile-stable ideas but often can't find the resources to achieve them. Financiers do no provided the resources because they consider the risks too great. We must do more than simply incentivising participants in the economy to bet on these ideas. So to increase the flow of resources to those that seek to increase the exposure of society to the dynamic quality, we must reduce the risk of making resources available. The blockchain allows for this by allowing us to fold the blockchain over failures in the future. When resources go from party A to B and then out to C, D, and E, we hope that someone along the chain makes good even if B fails miserably. By folding A to C, D, and E and providing a backflow of reward through this link, we can reduce the risk of capital investment in our societal system. Here we find the core and justification for the hypercatallaxian system.

#### XX. A demand for immortality

Once in a system where our future success depends on the success of those that we have contributed to in the past, and when those that have contributed to us depend on our continued success, a dynamic thing will happen. Those that depend on us, now a much wider net that just our decendants, will dread our deaths. Under current society, once we reach a certain age and stage, the world has more to gain from us kicking the bucket than sticking around. Under a hypercatallaxin system, this changes. This dependence of continued existence will drive medical research to a level where the life expectancy begins to increase at greater than a slope of 1. Here we find the beginning of immortality. We will certainly have many opportunities to mess it up along the way, and no guarantee exists, but a road does exist that we can point toward.

#### XXI. Conclusion

And thus we have reached our conclusion of an economics toward immortality. We will discuss much more. The rest of this book goes into the details of the economics and we follow with a generative, form, and pattern language for implementing the desired new economy.
