# Moral Struggles

We can simplify many of our moral discussions by using this framework.  In order to do this follow the following steps:

1.  Break the moving pieces of the problem into the economies at work.

2.  Abscribe moral authority to the more advanced economy:

Intellectual > Societal > Organic > Inorganic

3.  If the delimia is identified as being between two positions inside of a single economy, give authority that is shows the most quality / value inside that economy.

4.  I dentify how the agent with moral authority can act with moral responsibility toward each lower level involved.

A simple application follows.

Moral Dilemma:

A city wants to build a damn down river to generate power for the city and reduce dependance on exteranal energy sources.

First we break down the levels and the impact at each level:

Intellectual:  

Little implication - only application.

Societal:  

Increase in resources and productivity for the city.

Potential Reduced waterflow for downstream cities.

Organic:

Destruction of wildlife habitat.

Inorganic:

Reduction in Hydrocarbons released in burning of fossil fuels.

Humans get in trouble when assing situations like this when we start trying 'use our intelect' to solve the problem.  There really isn't in any Intellectual considerations here.  There is no symbolic representation and there is no scientific discovery involved.  Of course we need to use scientific discovery to buid the dam and to extract the electricity from the flow of water, but these are not really dilemmas.  The only implications we have at the intellectual level is the moral standing to say that we reliably know that building the dam will produce the energy we say it will.  Think how foolish it would be to affect lowere levels if we didn't know this!  What if someone were proposing buiding a giant cement cube in the desert to do the same?  We would ask why?  Why do you think this cement block will produce power.  All the societal, organic, and inorganic resources going toward it would be folly and ultimately immoral until it were proved that cube could provide more value than would go into it.

But we don't have a cube.  We have a dam and we know the dam will produce a massive amount of electricity for the nearby city.  We can study the economics of the resources this will provide and see that it is a very valuble thing!  We can see that building this dam may be a very moral thing to do, but we must take in all possible moral dilemmas into consideration.

Unfortunately the city down river is not happy about our plan. They fear that the dam will reduce their access to water.  Do they have a case?  Well if we apply rule 3 of our framework we have to ask a hard question.  Who provides more value inside of this economy of society?  The answer may be that the downstream entity is a thriving metropolis of 4 million people and a reduction in access to water could start a cholera epidemic and devistate their economy.  In this case the dam would be immoral.  If the town upriver is bigger and provides economic impact then the other town then building the dam may still be a moral choice.

How should the impact between the two cities be determined?  This should be a general utiltiy calculation inside of the economic layer.  This means in this case you don't figure in the organic or inorganic impact unless it destabalizes the societal layer.  Certainly a cholera epidemic in either place would disrupt productiona and value of existing resources quite a bit!  If the impoct is that more water will have to be pumped to the down river town and, if you do that, that the net production increase you may still want to do it.

At the extream this leads to a hard conclusion that building the dam has moral authority even if it ruins the down stream town as long as the long term benifit is more economic output that that town had initially.

But don't forget about Rule 4!  Don't fall prey to the destructive valley!
