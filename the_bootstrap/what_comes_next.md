# What comes next?

So what comes next?  How do we pursue what comes next?  Should we pursue what comes next?

There are a lot of questions here and very few answers.  Lets look at each possibility and see if we cna find examples of a bootstrap already occuring.

Inorganic -> Biology II

Biology -> System III

Society -> Supersociety

Intellegence -> Superintellegence

What we find is that predicing the next bootsrap is much more complicated that first considered because we now have four different frames through which to achieve it.

##Inorganic -> Biology II

The first scenario to consider is that the inorganic is not finished bootstrapping at all.  The biological was an impressive levraging of pattenred forces to an entier new system, but perhaps the carbon based bootstrap is just the first and most likely pattern to emerge as a coherent system.

In fact it is likely that if we spend enough time looking and changing our frame we will find all sorts of bootstraps taht have occured because of patterned forces.

The forming, expanding, and dying of galexies may be at one end of the time and distance scale where we see emergence of entities, with diversity and interaction.

On a much smaller scale, science is uncovering a number of inorganic pattenrns that can be maniplated to produce unique behavior.  It is likely that the conditions for some of these patterns to sustain themselves may take an intellegnce to produce.

Consider for example, an set of inorganiclly based neurons that have produce an intellegence that can sustain itself and spread itself.  From what we know about electricity and the forces involved, it is possible that this kind of bootstrap has already occured 'somewhere' out in the universe.  Many AI researchers are actively trying to pursue this kind of bootstrap.

The key thing to consider here is what would identify something as a unique Bioloby II instead of just another branch of our current biologicall bootstrap.  The answer is that the underlying economics of this Biology II would not use reproduction as the basis of it's new economics.

This is a very hard thing to even imagine, but lets try.  Consider something like 'the borg' in Star Trek.  Now this example has a bit of intellegence mixed in(otherwise it wouldn't be a very good story), but lets pretend that the borg didn't have an evil intellegence at its center, but instead just operated on the basis of 'assimilation'.  This system seeks to draw resources to itself and grow.

Like I said, the examples are hard, but there may be some merit in looking at genreal, base elements and considering, 'what system to I want to be at work here' and then aranging the elements in such a way that the elements pursue that agenda.  The bootstrap is what emerges out of that we don't expect.

You can see the areas of personalized medice and nanotechnology here.  You can also see the underlying threats of things like the gray goo scenario that we will talk about later.

In the end we still have the economics of patterned forces at the inorganic level, but we are looking for ways in which those forces emerge to prusue something other than 'survival of the fitest'

##Biology to System III

To date, biology has spawned two different bootstraps, the society bootstrap and the intellegence bootstrap.  What can we consider and say about a possible third system that could emerge out of biology?

We have two systems, one that values resource allocation, and one that values the observation of time.  Do we just start picking out other things that exist and doing thought experaments?

Let's take something like 'physical connection'.  In this thought exprament, our biological system begins to value havng as many connections with other entities as possible.  Consider a being that, when it encounters anthore being, can read its DNA and assimlate that DNA into its own. So in this system, to maximize the spread of your DNA you have to physically inhabit the same physical space as as many other beings as possible and then diversify out into the universe as far away from many of those entities as possible to ensure that you don't fall prey to some galactic event that wipes out all beings that you've connected with.  In this patttern I can see a number of very valuble patterns emerging around very fast space travel and communications.  What becomes important?  Finding other entites, getting there, and then spreading out.

We see posulazation about biological entities by people like Freeman Dyson that proposed a type of animal that is evolved for interstellar travel.

It is unlikely that anything on that scale is going to directly impact us here on earth though.  What is much more likely with our current tech are genetic engenering issues that lead to odd and potentially horrifying things that we see in fiction like predetors being specifically designed for war or chimeric efforts like the island of Dr. Morou.

In the end, it is the economics of biodiversity that must produce a system that revolves around something other than grouping or time observation.  We also have the added compnent that the bootstrap must be 'up'.  Biology has bootstraped a number of extrodinary systems in the inorganic space. We talk about these as structure and environment.  But these systems are not 'above' the biological and are based on a known area of operations.  This becomes much more important at the next two levels where we have a much richer area of 'known' areas to develop new systems in.

##Society to Super-Society

Society allocates resources and has produced, at the top of its evolution the use of cash money economics to allocate things efficiently.  This gets much more difficult because our world is filled with things that are based on the pursute and allocation of cash/resources that opperate at lower levels.  Culture(and the governemnts that it spawns) and art are produced at these 'known' levels.  It is very difficult to look beyond the know and think about what kind of system could the pursuite of resources produce that is 'beyond' the known areas, but that is what is really at the heart of this book.

It is the core tenet of this book that by reforming and targeting the way our money works, that we can enable this next bootstrap.  What will occur, I think, is that the reconfiguration of our pursuit of cash will develop expontially building institutions that trancende our 'known' areas.  Big dreams, but we have to start somewhere.

##Intellegence to Super-Intellegence

This one is fairly straight forward, but may not play out the way many expect.  This bootstrap isn't just faster intellegence.  Faster intellegence gets us there faster because the bootsrap builds ontop of the underlying structure of science.  But what will the super intellegence be?  What systems will emerge when science is so basic to a thing that a  systems is being built around it?
