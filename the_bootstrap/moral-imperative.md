## Moral Imperative

Our framework has established moral authority and moral responsibility. These principles can guide us when we face moral conflicts. This leaves us with how to approach our moral imperative when we face conflict. What should we do? What should humanity concern itself with? When we dream, what should we dream of?

Our observations about the world reveal that the universe is in the business of bootstraps and we draw from this a moral imperative to be in the business of enabling those bootstraps. Our intelligence lets us come alongside the universe and shepherd bootstraps consist of wholeness seeking moral authority and capable of wholeness preserving moral responsibility. This requires the synthesis of scientific knowledge and moral philosophy. We need to think deeply about this imperative and experiment around the edges to validate our theories.

This imperative unsettles us. Many of the world's religions and worldviews point to 'things happening for a reason.' Our moral framework douses this idea with the shocking cold water of the reality that bad things happen for the reason that we did not have the proper knowledge to keep them from happening.

Coming to grips with this reality should stir an urgency in the spirit of humanity. We need to stop looking toward the future to try to justify our cancers. Cancer does not 'happen for a reason.' It doesn't happen so that you can learn something new or become a stronger person. It happens because we do not have enough knowledge. And the knowledge exists undiscovered. It happens because we do not look for the right answers.

It happens because we have not yet developed the knowledge to detect it happening, eradicate it when it happens, and to keep it from happening. Our parents die because we have focused on banking, commercialization, and frivolity instead of delving the mysteries of biological systems and developing the knowledge to unravel those mysteries. We ignore our moral imperative when a majority of our Physics PHDs apply their limited time on this earth to making money in the financial markets instead of plumbing the depths of the universe's mysteries.

I do not have a ready answer for what we should do to comfort ourselves when things go sideways. I'm tempted to leave the question unanswered. If the eradication of disease and death does not entice us to move us in the right direction, perhaps this disconcerting reality will become a burr in our saddle that will cause us to always lean forward and seek relief.

The rest of this volume seeks to align our incentives to this moral framework.
