## The Biological to Intelligence

As a result of the inorganicâ€™s restraint to dealing in forces, we observe a number of different phenomena. We see the organization of the inorganic into organic compounds that bootstrap to life. Other bootstraps have occurred and we can see them around us in the solar system and out in our galaxy. Phenomena such as the sun, the planets, black holes, etc result from the interplay of forces in the inorganic world.

In the same way that the inorganic can bootstrap in many different ways, so can the biological. Specifically, that biology bootstrapped another kind of mind that does not just find its nature in the societal. This mind does not just deal in the trading off of resources. This mind deals in a very different resource that has always existed nature, but that the other economies that we have discussed have ignored. We called a mind an intellect and it has time at the core of its economics.

You may consider it an odd thing to say that time has no value at the inorganic, biological, and societal levels. Time presents at those levels, but not until the human mind do we see a bootstrap to a level where a system can deal in time and recall back to a previous state of nature and use that previous state to affect the future.

Natural law restricts the inorganic, biology submits to the mad blind god of evolution, society to the blind raptor god of the market, but with intellect, we achieve rationality and that changes everything. We can observe the past and project events into the future. This ability lacks perfection at every level, but it achieves superiority to society level. We often call this bootstrapped level of time use 'science.' The ability to observe the past and use those observations in a way that affect the future will help us bootstrap to a super-intelligence. But we have not achieved super-intelligence yet. This book tries to address what it will take to get there.

Just like the societal systems, the intellectual system has access to the levels below it. It also has the unique property that it can access a level notin its foundation, society.

Let's look at each level starting with society. What  economic system works on the intellectual - societal level? The economic system based on culture at the outset and culminating in diversity as it pursues quality culture. We see this level manifest itself in the study of the arts and many of the social sciences. We observe cultures, see how the development plays out, and then attempt to explain how and when similar patterns may emerge in the future. Do these patterns have quality?

At the intellectual - biological level we find the life sciences and in particular the study of human biology. Self preservation presents as the currency here. When we reach quality at this level, we finally find the immortality that I speak of in the title of this book. Much of the remainder of this book will seek to determine how we can steer and manipulate the economic system to reach this level of quality so that our existing minds will continue to exist far into the future.

At the intellectual - inorganic level we find the replayability of inorganic manipulations...in other words machines. When we pursue these machines to a level of quality we produce industry and develop the engineering sciences. Increasing the quality at this level will help us get to immortality as well as many of these machines help us self preserve at the biological level.

We find ourselves, in our modern world, with a brain that has two minds inside of it. System One processes things in a frame without time. It reacts instantly and in a reactionary manner. It colors all we see and what we see is all there is. System Two presents as a mind that understands and uses time to its advantage. Currently, System Two does a very poor job of avoiding the influence of System One because it developed with that system in place. Many of the arguments we get in about what our modern life should look like find basis in the fact that we don't think much about the fact that these two minds have two very different economic models. In fact, between society and the intellect we have seven different economies all interacting and crossing over. Perhaps by separating them out and creating a framework for thinking about them from a moral perspective we can begin to find a path to the place in the future where we all want to be.
