## A Moral Framework

Something interesting starts to happen when you have two systems working with and against each other. You could say you have a fight over the rights of each system. We can call this a moral dilemma. Who wins? I believe that the system that develops out of another system has the right to have control over the lower system. We call this moral authority. This right is always paired with a needed set of things that system should and should not do. We call this moral responsibility. Do unto the other economies as you would want done unto yours.

We will explore this framework in the next few sections.
