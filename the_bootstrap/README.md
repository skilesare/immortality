# The Bootstrap

We are going to explore our modern world from the smallest level up to our modern mind.  How did we get from there to here?  I call this the bootstrap and there are a number of phases that our universe has gone through to put humans on this planet at this time in history.  We are going to look at each level and explore how it led to the the higher level system emerging.
