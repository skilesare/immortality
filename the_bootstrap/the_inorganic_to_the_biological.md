## The Inorganic to the Biological

The inorganic can be subdivided into three levels:

1. Sub-Atomic
2. Atomic
3. Molecular

I will not speak much about the subatomic level as I currently have only a vague understanding of the mechanics at that level. We can consider the choice between a collapsing quantum reality or a reality that has branching universes. I think, with some some trepidation, that we will find reality emerging out of infinite randomness.

The subatomic level supports the atomic level and our observations here gives us some of our first evidence of ‘how the world works.’ Ultimately we find the very important fact of atomic fungibility. One atom of an element cannot be distinguished from another element of the same type under the same forces. An atom of oxygen on earth, and an atom of oxygen on Mars will react in the same way to the local forces if swapped. We can consistently predict the reaction of that molecule to local forces even in vastly different environments..

Because of the consistency of these atoms, they behave reliably. These items group reliably into molecules.  The fact that this behavior happens, and happens reliably, establishes the core of most of our 'hard' sciences. If you heat water at -2 degrees C to 10 degrees C, it behaves in a very predictable way and a scientist on the other side of the planet can reproduce the same experiment and see the same results.

Fortunately for us, atoms did not stick to just forming a finite set of molecules. One particular atom, Carbon, has properties that allow it to make many different formations. These dynamic formations have so many emergent properties that we call them 'organic.' Organic chemistry studies carbon based molecules made up of tens, hundred, or even, in the case of DNA, millions of atoms. The behavior of organic molecules have much, much more diversity than standard molecules and less predictability.

We will call this step up from the standard molecules to massively complex molecules a bootstrap. We will ultimately see the bootstrap at many different levels of reality and ultimately we will base much of our theories on a conclusion that the universe, ultimately, engages in the business of bootstraps.

This inorganic bootstrap takes us from a very predictable set of behaviors in basic molecules to advanced organic molecules that we begin to see as biological system. These biological systems reproduce themselves and diversify themselves. While the methods that biological systems use to reproduce and diversify themselves build on the underlying interactions of forces at the inorganic level, they ultimately overcome those forces and interact at a level that operates independent of the organic level.

A fairly thin line comes into focus here that must be observed. Scientific circles may find it a bit heretical to say that the biological has no dependency on the inorganic. Of course the inorganic still has a causal relationship with the biological and the biological builds on the foundation of the inorganic, but I'm specifically talking, in terms of economics and value here. Biological basis of value diverges completely from the basis of value in inorganic things.

One can raise skepticism when we start talking about  inorganic molecules ‘wanting' or 'valuing' something. It even seems unrealistic to think of small biological systems like bacteria 'valuing' or 'wanting.' I don't mean to over anthropomorphize here and I invite you to try to take as much of the humanness out of those words as possible. Focus on the unit exchanged and used in each of those systems to move the system forward.

Let us take a step back and consider the inorganic and try to define an economics of that level of organization.

We find a set of forces interacting as the center of value in the inorganic realm. This manifests itself in the form of orbiting electrons. The supply and demand curves at this level exhibit remarkably simplicity. Molecules want their outermost shell of electrons to be full. An oxygen molecule needs two extra electrons to have its outer shell full. It turns out that hydrogen has one electron so two of them together can complete oxygen's outer shell, and all of a sudden we have a new entity called H2O that exerts its own unique set of forces on the universe.

In the early atoms in the periodic table we see some rumblings of the life creating structure and processes, but when we get to carbon we really begin to see the whole system begin to shine and we head toward our bootstrap condition.

Chris Alexander introduces his 15 life structures and associated life creating processes in his Nature of Order. They are:

1. Levels of Scale
2. Strong Centers
3. Thick Boundaries
4. Alternating Repetition
5. Positive Space
6. Good Shape
7. Local Symmetry
8. Deep interlock and ambiguity
9. Contrast
10. Gradients
11. Roughness
12. Echos
13. The Void
14. Simplicity and Inner Calm
15. Each in the Other

Carbon allows such a myriad of different combinations (including combining with itself) that it can exhibit all of these characteristics and achieve the bootstrap to biological reality. We will refer to this organization as 'patterned forces.' If you prefer to think in the frame of the classic / romantic split, the forces exhibit romanticism, and the patterned forces classicism. You need both working together to achieve the bootstrap.

We will return to this list of characteristics and processes at each level as the seem to be at the core of what consider to be 'life'. They weave a common red thread through a tapestry of very different fabrics.

After the bootstrap we find a new biological system. The value at this level of reality differs from the inorganic level. In fact, we see that most of the functionality we see at this level centers around overcoming the forces that were valued at the lower level.

At the biological level we meet fitness where reproduction and survival find value. Evolution wants to spread genes as far and as wide as it can. The inorganic bootstrap culminated in a molecule that reproduces itself and spreads across its environment.

The biological level sits above the inorganic. As a result, it has access to the inorganic level even if it has a different value structure. In fact biological systems use inorganic material as their major tool. Biological systems have adapted to create structure out of inorganic material in a way that increases the biological system's ability to further overcome the inorganic forces.

We find the biological level operating on two different and distinct economies. We also find it trying to achieve two different and distinct bootstraps. First we will address biology dealing with the inorganic level.
