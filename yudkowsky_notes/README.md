# Yudkowsky Notes


- Our examples need to be 'Bayes Optimal'


> Reality, we have learned to our shock, is not a collection of separate magisteria, but a single unified process governed by mathematically simple low-level rules.


Yudkowsky, Eliezer (2015-03-11). Rationality: From AI to Zombies (Kindle Locations 13327-13328). Machine Intelligence Research Institute. Kindle Edition.

> So unless you can tell me which specific step in your argument violates the laws of physics by giving you true knowledge of the unseen, don’t expect me to believe that a big, elaborate clever argument can do it either.

> Unanswerable questions do not mark places where magic enters the universe. They mark places where your mind runs skew to reality.

Yudkowsky, Eliezer (2015-03-11). Rationality: From AI to Zombies (Kindle Locations 13755-13756). Machine Intelligence Research Institute. Kindle Edition.

> Surprise exists in the map, not in the territory.

Yudkowsky, Eliezer (2015-03-11). Rationality: From AI to Zombies (Kindle Location 14086). Machine Intelligence Research Institute. Kindle Edition.

> This, as I see it, is the thesis of reductionism. Reductionism is not a positive belief, but rather, a disbelief that the higher levels of simplified multilevel models are out there in the territory. Understanding this on a gut level dissolves the question of “How can you say the airplane doesn’t really have wings, when I can see the wings right there?” The critical words are really and see.

> It takes a strong mind, a deep honesty, and a deliberate effort to say, at this point, “That which can be destroyed by the truth should be,” and “The scientist hasn’t taken the gnomes away, only taken my delusion away,”

> They are savanna poets, who can only tell stories that would have made sense around a campfire ten thousand years ago. Savanna poets, who can tell only the Great Stories in their classic forms, and nothing more.

> At the very least, to get close to the truth, you have to be willing to press yourself up against reality as tightly as possible, without flinching away, or sneering down.

> But if you don’t have the capacity to enjoy hang-gliding even though it is merely real, then as soon as dragons turn real, you’re not going to be any more excited by dragons than you are by hang-gliding.

"And this is why you are going to invest your money with me.  I'm wiling to bind my self to reality where you are not.  I'm will to push churches, states, families to a place to a place where they will use the merely real as magic to change the course of history.  You could think for a life time about all the magical things that you want to do with your money.  You will never accomplich a single magical act.  I will accomplish the real.  I'm bound to it." - AAF

> So remember the Litany Against Being Transported Into An Alternate Universe: If I’m going to be happy anywhere, Or achieve greatness anywhere, Or learn true secrets anywhere, Or save the world anywhere, Or feel strongly anywhere, Or help people anywhere, I may as well do it in reality.

> The Ultimate Power. The user of this ability contains a smaller, imperfect echo of the entire universe, enabling them to search out paths through probability to any desired future. If this sounds like a ridiculously powerful ability, you’re right— game balance goes right out the window with this one. Extremely rare among life forms, it is the sekai no ougi or “hidden technique of the world.”

> If God did speak plainly, and answer prayers reliably, God would just become one more boringly real thing, no more worth believing in than the postman.

"So is he witholding the answer an the action to be tricksy?  Is that the God you think you worship?  The Tricksy one?" -AAF

> There is nothing but science to learn— the emotional energy must either be invested in reality, or wasted in total nonsense, or destroyed. For myself, I think it is better to invest the emotional energy; fun should not be needlessly cast away.
