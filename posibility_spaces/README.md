## Possibility Spaces

It should be instructive to look at the jump in possibility space in the inorganic to the possibility space in the biological to realize the significant hurdle to that we have to overcome in finding a society -> supersociety or intelligence -> superintelligence bootstrap. Biology has a super exponential magnitude of possibility space over the inorganic which we see significant movement in the inorganic self organization on the scale of microseconds and why biological changes can take eons.

The next bootstrap has a massive possibility space. I think that intelligence has given us a hack we can use to short circuit this seemingly unmovable mountain. Our use of the mathematical laws of probability and the mastering of the scientific method will allow us to restrict the possibility spaces.
