## Possibility Spaces


It should be instructive to look at the jump in possibility space in the inorganic to the possibility space in the biological to realize the significant hurdle to that we have to overcome in finding a society -> super society or intelligence -> superintelligence bootstrap. Biology has a super exponential magnitude of possibility space over the inorganic which is probably why we saw significant movement on in the inorganic self organization on the scale of microseconds and while the biological changes can take eons.

This is a sobering thought that the next bootstrap has such a massive possibility space. I think that intelligence has given us a hack we can use to short circuit this seemingly unmovable mountain. Our use of the mathematical laws of probability and the mastering of the scientific method will allow us to restrict the possibility spaces.
