# Posibility Spaces


It shold be instructive to look at the jump in possibily space in the inorganic to the possibility space in the biolocial to realize the significant hurdle to that we have to overcome in finding a society -> supersociety or intellegence -> super intellegence bootstrap.  Biology has a super exponential magnitued of possibility space over the inorganic which is probably why we saw signifiant movement on in the inorganic self organization on the scale of microseconds and while the biological changes can take eons.

This is a sobering thought that the next bootstrap has such a massive possibilty space.  I think that intellegence has given us a hack we can use to short circut this seeminly unmoveable mountain.
