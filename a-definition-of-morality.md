## A definition of morality

What is good and right?  Our moral framework should answer this question.  People have sought to derive from morality from ancient texts, from royal decree, and from moral philosophy.  This book assumes that morality emerges from the very meta-physics of our universe.  We can see what our moral framework should be by simply looking around us at what is.

This is not going to be enough for many people.  In a sense it is a presuppisition that it is good and right for there to be this reality we live in and that we can derive what is good and right by observing what we see.
