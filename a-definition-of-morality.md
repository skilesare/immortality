## A Definition of Morality

What is good and right? Our moral framework should answer this question. People have sought to derive morality from ancient texts, from royal decree, and from moral philosophy. This book assumes that morality emerges from the very metaphysics of our universe. We should see what our moral framework by simply looking around us at what is.

Many people will not find satisfaction in this. In a sense we must use it as a presupposition that it is good and right for this reality we live in to exist and that we can derive the good and right by observing what we see.

### On the Duality of Morality

We will find a Moral Authority given to more advanced and complex entities by observing thew world around us. This Moral Authority must always balance with a Moral Responsibility given from the more advanced and complex entities to lesser entities. The reality that any lesser entity may springboard to a new and more complex entity that has never existed before demands this approach.

### On Evil

Evil arises in two ways.

The first, when the moral authority threatens from below.

The second, when the moral responsibility gets ignored or is technologicaly impossible. This often manifests in a 'moral dilemma' that we seemingly cannot overcome without committing some evil.

### On Knowledge

But we do not find ourselves left alone with this evil. We can explain. And we can codify our explanations so that we know. Our minds are universal explainers. And using the tools we have on hand, and the ones we will develop, we should strive to become universal constructors. If becomeing a universal constructor is allowed by the physics of our universe, we should seek the right knowlege to accomplish that end.

### On Overcoming Evil

We will find that morality demands that a universal explainer try to explain evil, develop knowledge about that evil, and use the knowledge gained to annihilate that evil.

More knowledge protects entities from lower forces that would undo them.

More knowledge allows entities to act with proper responsibility to lower entities.
