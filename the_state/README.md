## The State

Is 'The State' the bootstrap of society to supersociety?

In this chapter I will discuss this possibility and look at the questions that arise from this proposed bootstrap.

For a system to bootstrap we must look at the economics of a system, the economics of the more advanced system, and ask if the economics rest on different forms of value. If they have a difference then a bootstrap has occurred. If they do not have a difference then a bootstrap has not occurred and the system has just evolved to a higher level within an economy, possibly, with a higher level of quality. We may still have found a place where we can make a morality judgment because the level has a higher place in the cascade, but if the economics haven't changed we do not have a bootstrap.

In the societal layer we find resources being the unit of value. The societal system engages in possessing resources, having access to resources, and seeking out resources.

The state possesses a higher level organization than general society. But do we see differences in the economic drivers? We see at high levels of the nation state some evidence of an economics of 'power'. How many Senators can we marshall on an issue? Ultimately, we do not see a new form of economics though. The decision makers in nation states currently still rely on resources, monetary campaign donations in the US, for their power. Access to resources drives the power structure.

If the State separated itself from the effect of resource allocation it may find a bootstrap.  The US Supreme Court leans toward this dynamic. Because this court has lifetime appointments the justices make decisions independent of resource allocation. This  areas of government gives us very little information about its decision making process. The court does not allow cameras in and the interplay of decision making only gets  recorded after the fact in opinions. We completely miss out on the process and insight into the unit of value that moves an opinion one way or the other.

Letâ€™s consider for a moment that society reaches a point where the actors in the state get selected by lot in a way that insures that currently controlling more resources doesn't impact your selectability. What would these resource independent statesmen involve themselves in? The population would demand that they engage in the allocation and protection of resources. More of the same.

We conclude that the State does not a bootstrap to supersociety. That does not mean that the state will not become integral in the bootstrap to the supersociety. We conclude that in order for society to bootstrap to a supersociety, resource allocation and use needs as muc optimization as possible. To reach this conclusion we will look at the economics of the previous bootstrap and then explore how to best position society and the state to emulate these process of these economies reaching bootstrap.
