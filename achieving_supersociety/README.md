# Achieving Supersociety

1.  Establish a Blockchain based marketplace with hypercatallaxian features
 
    A. Increased cash flows via decaying currency.

    B. Reduce risk by blockchain folding over failed entities.

    C. Tie government regulation and rule of law to the execution of transactions on the blockchain.

2.  Establish an extended republic that supports a peaceful global society subject to a common set of hypercatallaian markets.

The following sections will discuss the basics of these two major systems.  They will be followed by a robust explication of all the moving pieces of this new kind of economy in the 'Democratic Hypercatallaxy' Section.  We then will propose a new US constitution, based almost wholly on the existing document, that embeds this economic system in the foundations of our liberal democratic republic.
