# Loan Officers



Loan Officers bid on chunks of the loan pool. They then are issued the currency and are able to distribute it to people that they see fit to be issued a loan. They cannot change the interest rate. Instead, they compete on their ability to help the issuer turn the loaned funds into cash producing capital.



Loan officers make their money off of the prefs paid from the accounts they give loans to.
