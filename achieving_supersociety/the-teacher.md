### The Teacher



Who: The teacher is entrusted with the education of our children. They are typically underpaid for the service they perform and are usually the most robbed of the full output of their labor.



How will our system affect teachers? Education prefs will be given to teachers by their students. As a result, producing productive students will lead to large pref payments later in life.



We anticipate competition for the right to be teachers as it will become one of the most sure ways to wealth.
