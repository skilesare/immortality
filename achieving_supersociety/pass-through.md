### Pass Through

Accounts can be elected to pass through status on their way to being closed. In a pass through account, the prefs payments pass through 100% without being taxed. These accounts can be set up to help keep regional or strategic accounts separated.

Pass through accounts cannot hold a balance so that cash paid in flows directly trough to the owning account.
