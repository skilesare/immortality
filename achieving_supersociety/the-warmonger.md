# The Warmonger



Who: The warmonger seeks profit from war and the destruction of physical and human capital.



How will our system affect the warmonger? The production of ammunition, machines of war, and war supplies produce nothing of value. They are wasted capital. Would you rather put your money into something that was then in the business of producing productive capital or into something that was going to pile your money into a pile, light it on fire, and shoot it at an enemy?



In addition if a community of teachers and business people that have invested years of wages into a people, and own a massive number of prefs in them, how likely will they be to send them off to have bullets shot at their heads?



Prefs will make the economics of war much more difficult and a much harder sell.
