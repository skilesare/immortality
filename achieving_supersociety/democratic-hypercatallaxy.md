# Democratic Hypercatallaxy

Why do we need a new form of money? Money is unnatural. It does not die and therefore can lead to unfair advantage. With our new form of money we seek to naturalize money and fix a lot of issues along the way.

This ne kind of money differes for 3 core reasons:

1. Our new money has the property of demurrage. Demurrage controls inflation by baking it into our monetary system. This demuragge means you must constantly pay a fee to keep your money 'current' and usable.

2. Our new money demands that a form of artificial capital\(aka prefs\) be given to the sender of funds along with goods and services in the event of a transaction. Spending our new money becomes a form of investment. The demurrage from our new money becomes the dividend paid to owners of this capital. Since no transaction can be performed without the transfer of capital we aim to democratize 'capitalism' and make every citizen a capitalist. ‘No cash without capital.’

3. It allows taxpayers the right to veto the use of state run accounts. Regular periods giving the citizens the right to freeze state run accounts makes the people much more powerful in their democratic self government. The executive, the legislative, and the judiciary make up the three pillars of our government. We add the fourth check to the balance of a direct citizen veto of the ability for governments to transact business.

I propose 'Art' as a  technical implementation. There maybe other better solutions, but I feel like I should not present a problem without some sort of solution proposed.

Why Art? We propose that people should be 'compensated for the full output of their labor'. Their labor becomes their Art. A unit of production echos into the future indefinitely and each laborer should have some right to the value produced from their own labor.

This idea of 'full output of labor' orginated with socialists and communists. I in no way want to associate with these movements. In fact, I have attempted to swing this concept completely on its head. I conclude that the communists and socialists missed the fact that laborers did not obtain their full output because society had not become capitalistic enough. At the same time, the hypercatallaxy I propose reaches a much more egalitarian level than our current form of capitalism.

In the following sections we discuss a theoretical coin called 'art' which seeks to:

* institutionalize hypercatallaxian economics
* bring about the simplification of taxes
* end the deathless corporations
* end indentured employment
* provide for the education of our children
* empower democratic ideals of self government
* increase transparency
* enrich the laboring class
* return the human capital wasted in the finance industry to progressive endeavors
* ensure social security and a thriving economy.

In the first section, 'Generating a new form of money' we seek to form a generative language to lead to the adoption of art as the dominant form of money.

The task overreaches my abliity to try to tackle all of these things and I would hesitate if the following things were not true:

1. The solution has simplicity.

2. The recent invention of digital money makes it possible.

In 'The Form Language' we take a look at democratic hypercatallaxy and build a form language of items to use in the construction of our new form of money. This section speaks to those that want to take a deeper look at the concept of democratic hypercatallaxy and the forms that make the engine run.

In 'The Pattern Language' we take a look at the pattern language considered for this document. This section speaks specifically to those fans of the pattern languages and the work of Christopher Alexander. Do not feel you have to read this section. I record it for those wanting a deeper understanding of the basics of democratic hypercatallaxy. This pattern langauge became the basis of the form and generative language.

I know I'm biting off way more than I can chew with this so  I'm putting it out at this point and hoping to get feedback and help in dicerning the practicality of these ideas and the practicality of actually implementing them.
