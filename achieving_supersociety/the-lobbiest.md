# The Lobbyist



Who: The lobbyist is an individual that is paid by an industry to seek undue influence in government.



How will our system affect the lobbyist? Because of the public ledger, the people should be very wary of public officials that receive payments from the privacy pool. This will reduce corruption.



In addition, the veto will give much more power to citizens to fight against lobbyist. In fact, lobbyist will likely need to move much of their 'lobbying' from the public official to the actual people and tax payers who can deny the public official his pay. The people will listen with much more critical ears.
