## A Generative Language for a new form of money

This secion seeks to outline a (re)generative process that will allow our new form of money to become the dominant form of currency in the near future. We will also allow for some outlets for the next thing to come along. For example, our system would not work well for interplanetary and interstellar travel. These problems remain for us to solve another day.

We will first discuss our ideal System.

We will then discuss our assumptions about the current environment that we engage with.

Next we will discuss how to move from an initial seed to our full vision.

Finally we will discuss what the missing pieces from our vision and how can we can engage the community to fill in those holes.

The proposed social structures should bootstrap this economy. If a stronger infrastructure becomes necessary I have a following section that will propose fundamental changes to the United States Constitution that will prop up many of these institutions in the foundational document of our democracy.
