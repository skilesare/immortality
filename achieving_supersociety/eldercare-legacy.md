### Elder care Legacy


For elderly who have no children or children that are unable to provide for their care, the elderly may mark a portion of their prefs that would go to legacy taxes to eldercare.  Dividends received from these marked prefs will flow to the service provider for the duration of the citizens life, but will be forfeited upon death.
