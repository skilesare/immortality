### Retaining Rate



This is the amount an account can protect from Demurrage.


Protected money is put up for for loan via the money system.

As an example, if the retaining rate is 10%, an account with $1000 in it would have $100 protected from demurrage.

The sum of retained funds are made available via the loan pool.
