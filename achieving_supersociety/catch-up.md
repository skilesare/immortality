### Catch Up


Catch up occurs whenever an account wants to spend cash or after regular periods of inactivity.

Catch up calculates the amount of demurrage since the last catch up and adds that amount to the pending transaction but directs the payment to a central processing account.

That central account will split out tax amounts and distribute the payments to target and tax accounts  when the amounts reach a reasonable amount.
