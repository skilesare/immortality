### The Beggar



Who: The beggar is in poverty. The beggar cannot afford food or a roof over her head.



How will our system affect the beggar? She will benefit by just living. Even the scraps that fall off the table of society will eventually add up to a significant number of prefs.



Governments will be much more empowered to help the beggar because they will be able to limit the amount of time they help until the account has enough prefs to continue on its own.
