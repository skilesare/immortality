## The Fragility of Banking and the Antifragile Answer

We see from Taleb that the current fragility of the banking industry. He calls it picking up nickels in front of a steam roller. Bankers take our money and loan it out assuming all the loans will not fail at the same time. In doing this they pick up nickels and give us pennies calling it a win-win. Until all the loans do fail at the same time and the dollars we gave them to get our pennies disappear into thin air. Volatility destroys this fragile system.

To turn it on its head we need a system exhibits antifragile properties. Volatility should increase our return. Hypercatallaxy accomplishes this in two ways. We loan the dollar to the bank and get a share of the bank's account. They make loans to a business. This business spends the cash with other businesses. Some of these businesses do well and other fail. When one fails we can 'fold the blockchain' and connect the source of cash to the destination of cash across the failing entity.

This form of reducing risk by folding the blockchain extends not just to banking but all forms of financing whether it be venture capital or a loan between family members.  The destruction of weak links that also maintains value flows means that our system gets stronger even as market conditions swing wildly.  This antifragile will break down at some point of volatility but will show remakable adaptability and resilience up to that point.

We add to this dividends that comes from the economic activity produced in specific accounts tied to spending.  This produces a natural value seeking process that finds the positive black swans and distributes the benefits back through the system via the decaying currency.

The blockchain provides further disintermediation via its trustless underpinnings.  This disitermediation futher disrupts the banks and lets people connect directly with each other leaving a resilent lending network without middlemen.
