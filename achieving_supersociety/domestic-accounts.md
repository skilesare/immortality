# Domestic Accounts

Domestic accounts should be established to allow for family units to participate in the economy as a co-entity and share prefs in the future.

These Domestic Accounts should have no more than 5 members unless established via rule of law.

For example, two domestic partners may join their citzen accounts under a domestic account. This will have the following effects:

1.  Any financial activity will distribute the prefs to the two members equally.

2.  If the domestic account is dissolved, the entities that own prefs in the domestic account will have their prefs split between the splitting entities.

3.  If one member passes away, all prefs may pass to the others without being subject to legacy.

These accounts protect memebers of a familty who choose to take on the burden of child rearing, domestic managment, and other family activites that do not involve the earning and spending of financial capital.

Generally children should not be involved in these types of accounts unless the child is working and still living at home with the parents.
