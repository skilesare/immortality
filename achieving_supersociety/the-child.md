### The Child



Who: The child is a young person below working age. The child should be engaged in whole world education including both physical education as well as mental education.



How will our system help the child? She will be much better cared for. By providing future compensation for parents that choose to stay home and by drastically increasing the earning potential of teachers, the care given to each child will be significantly increased.



In addition, upon reaching a working age, the student will have a number of people invested in their account and who will help the child succeed.
