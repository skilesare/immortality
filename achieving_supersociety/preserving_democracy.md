## Preserving Democracy

Our technology is driving the world to a smaller and smaller state. The current lines we draw between countries are a clear source of cultural and societal strife. They operate at a societal level. We need to exert our intellectual moral authority over these lines and dismantle them. At the same time we want to do so in a responsible way that preserves the vast culture that thrives based on these lines. We also want to adhere to stepwise refinement and allow these lines to dissolve in a way that increases the whole.

Fortunately for us the intellectual ideals of a liberal democracy and a republic mesh fairly well. We also have a document in the US constitution that has shown a remarkable resilience across massive changes in population distributions and technological advances. It is of course far from perfect, but it to can be subject to stepwise refinement.

We propose assigning the government as a signer on cash transactions so that it can impose a rule of law, but also so that it can itself be regulated by the citizens via a direct veto of governmental accounts.
