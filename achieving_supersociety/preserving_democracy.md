# Preserving Democracy

Our technology is driving the world to a smaller and smaller state.  The current lines we draw between countries are a clear source of cultural and societal strife.  They operate at a that societal level.  We need to exert our intellectual moral authority over these lines and dismantle them.  At the same time we want to do so in a responsible way that preserves the vast culture that thrives based on these lines.  We also want to adhear to stepwise refinment and allow these lines to disolve in a way that increases the whole.

Fortunately for us the intellectual ideals of a liberal democracy and a republic mesh fairly well.  We also have a document in the US constitution that has shown a remarkable resiliance across massive changes in population distributions and technolgical advances.  It is of course far from perfect, but it to can be subject to step-wise refinement.

We propose assiging the government as a signer on cash transactions so that it can both impose a rule of law, but also so that it can itself be regulated by the citizens via a direct veto of governmental accounts.
