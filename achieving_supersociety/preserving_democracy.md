## Preserving Democracy

Our technology drives the world to a smaller and smaller state. The current lines we draw between countries clearly lead to  cultural and societal strife. They operate at a societal level. We need to exert our intellectual moral authority over these lines and dismantle them. At the same time we want to do so in a responsible way that preserves the many cultures that thrives based on these lines. We also want to adhere to stepwise refinement and allow these lines to dissolve in a way that increases the whole.

Fortunately for us the intellectual ideals of a liberal democracy and a republic mesh fairly well. We also have a document in the US constitution that has shown a remarkable resilience across massive changes in population distributions and technological advances. The constitution lacks perfection, but its nature enables us to apply stepwise refinement to it.

In a later chapter I will propose assigning the government as a signer on cash transactions so that it can impose a rule of law, but also so that citizens can regulated the state via a direct veto of governmental accounts.  This additional check and balance on state power should allow us to preserve the democratic ideals we currently value while reasserting control of the people over the state.
