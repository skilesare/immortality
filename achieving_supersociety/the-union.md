# The Union



Who: The union is a group organized to represent the rights of laborers in an industry. They wield the power of negotiation and can strike to demand the satisfaction of demands.



How will our system affect unions? Unions will thrive under our system of money. Companies will need them to organize the apprenticeship and improvement of the laborer's skills. Without an increase in production the companies not see the return on their prefs that they want. They will rely on and fund the unions to move laborers to higher and higher pay tiers.



The laborer will rely more on the union as they seek to find more diverse employment opportunities.



Over all the union will see a resurgence and increase in power. If workers strike it will now be a double blow to the company due to reduced production and a lack of new pref payments.
