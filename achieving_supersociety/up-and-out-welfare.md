# Up and Out Welfare



This concept speaks to the fact that 'lifetime' welfare will no longer be necessary. Even if the citizen makes no effort, or is completely unable to pursue commerce, eventually the number of prefs the person will have from spending their welfare stipend will be equal to one years worth of stipend. Using the public ledger and rule of law, the state should manage this so that everyone is able to have their needs of human dignity met.
