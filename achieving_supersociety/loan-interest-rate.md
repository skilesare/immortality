### Loan Interest Rate



This is the rate of interest that is charged by the loan pool for short term rates. We believe that this rate will tend toward 0%. Longer terms may have a positive interest rate, but ultimately, the market will decide this. If there are few bids for long term loans, the rate can drop. If there are too many bids, we may want lower the rate.
