# Tax



A portion of the Demurrage is allocated to tax. This amount is determined by:



1. The issuer with required tax

2. The citizen by electing tax

3. The legal entity by electing tax



Some elective taxes may be required by rule of law. For instance, the state of Texas may require an entity to elect a tax to operate in the state.



The percentages of tax are removed from the Demurrage amount before the pref payments are sent out.



For example:



US Tax: 15%

Texas Tax: 8%

Houston Tax: 1.5%

Dock Workers Union: 0.1%



Total tax: 24.6%



Demurrage Amount: $1000



Tax: $246

To Pref Payments: $754



These amounts are transferred to the Corporate Accounts as pref payments.



What about Tax on State Accounts? Tax on state accounts is removed from the money supply. This is how our form of money naturally degrades.
