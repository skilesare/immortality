### Assumptions

Why can we not jump start this system?

I assume that citizens will look at the system skeptically at first. They will need ‘training’' to understand the idea of prefs and the financial impact they can have on their lives.

I assume that this system will disrupt the existing power structure. We anticipate the distraction of the populace via war, patriotism, and slander. We must find a way to encourage people to look at the respect for humanity our system seeks to employ.

I assume the state will not run with this from the get go. We will provide for the eventual nationalization of the system. This is not something to fear and we should plan for it from the beginning. This system could lead to a nation-stateless society, but if we observe recent history we are not quite ready for that.

I assume that merchants will take convincing as well. Why would they want a money that 'dies' unspent? We will have to overcome these fears by encouraging the populace to demand the acceptance of Art.

I assume the banks will fight this tooth and nail. The people will need to demand the reduction of the financial industry. Ultimately we don't expect the public to resist this, but we do expect the industry to fight with all their power to keep the status quo.

I assume 'they' will call these ideas 'communist', 'socialist', 'unrealistic', etc. Remember the mantra, 'if capitalism is so great, then I demand capital for my dollar.' Together, we need to no longer let ourselves be taken advantage of by those have the power.

I also assume that this is doable. Art has a secret weapon.
