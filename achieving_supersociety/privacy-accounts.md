### Privacy Pools

Privacy pools are issued by the issuer to protect the right to privacy of its citizens.

We recommend one general privacy account that all private payments travel through. This will maximize the privacy because smaller numbers of transaction can lead to the owner of a transaction being deduced by process of elimination.

Legal Entities can receive payments from privacy pools, but cannot issue payments to privacy pools. This protects citizens from corporations that try to mask their financial dealings.

Payments through privacy pools may take time to process and the system should wait for a substantial number of inputs and separate the payments into chunks that are distributed over time so that source and destination payments cannot be matched.

Privacy pools may also have additional taxes on them. Privacy is a right of the citizen, but that does not mean it has no cost. Private transactions between citizens could lead to black market activities that are detrimental to society, so a tax may be necessary to dissuade the use of privacy accounts and provide for the enforcement of the rule of law.
