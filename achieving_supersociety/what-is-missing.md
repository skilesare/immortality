### What is missing?


This section lacks detail and needs expansion. I'm not the best with logistics and need your help to flesh out the exact generative language to make this a reality. Iâ€™ve published this book on github and we accept pull request. If you have a deep knowledge of the banking system, blockchain, technology, financial transaction technology, etc, we'd love for you to help us fill in the blanks.

The steps outlined in Seed To Vision need to critiqued and expanded. 

We need help writing the monte carlo simulations outlined in the next section. Developers who want to help us with the simulation and analysis of the results will find a warm welcome.
