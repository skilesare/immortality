### Veto



Citizens can veto the right for a issuer or domain account to 'catch up'. Until the impasse is solved the account of the state will be frozen. Citizens can vote 'abstain', 'deny', 'override'. Abstain does nothing, deny will deny the accounts operation if there are more deny votes than override votes. Enough override votes will open the account again.



In addition, citizens can block the payment of funds from agency accounts if a specific issue is under debate. Again citizens can vote 'abstain', 'deny', 'override'.
