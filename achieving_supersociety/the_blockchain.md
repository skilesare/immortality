## The Blockchain

Why does the blockchain capture the imagination of so many people that really understand it? The blockchain consists of an intellectual construct laid on top of the societal layer to increase its robustness. It takes time, the economy of the intellect, and applies it to the economy of society.

Resource based economies generally ignore time. Our human-societal brains(System I) will even trick us into taking a smaller sum of cash now than at a point in the future even when the return in the future grows ridiculously high. Not until the return grows so large will our human-intellectual brains(system II) trip and make us say...wait a second....I'll wait.

The acceptance of money as a form of payment emerges as a bit of a miracle. We somehow figured out intellectually the advantage of using a stand in for our sheep and wheat in exchange. This timeshifting of resources helps us, but subjects itself to a number of bad actions that breaks the trust. In fact we hear often that trust people have in money gives it its value. Money is just paper(or bits in a machine). The blockchain takes this to a logical end point by codifying money across time. The problem with money still remains that as market conditions change, the value of money can drastically change.

If we want  'enough' money out in the world, the quantity shold match the amount needed to buy all the goods produced. Of course things can change very quickly and things like a war could greatly reduce the amount of output that an economy can generate. Controling the money supply grows difficult when this happens and it typically leads to some form of instability. But with the blockchain, all transactions filter through a set of intermediaries. If the economy collectively decides on a necesary 1/3 reduction in money supply, the blockchain can enforce that reduction on the next transaction of each account in the system via either the underlying algorithm or by a hard fork. I do not suggest we do anything as drastic as this because it could decrease the predictability of markets and markets thrive on predictability.

The blockchain acts as a sort of time machine for our resources. We can walk backwards in time and make decisions based on moneyâ€™s history and we can put future restrictions on cash via smart contracts. We will find difficulty future proofing any system, so our smart contracts need to also have flexibility. An important field of study emerges: figuring out how to maintain flexibility without having a gameable system.

I think the final system will need to subject itself to rule of law and integrate the fundamental principles of common law. Common law dictates that customs and judicial precedent can affect change the implementation of the law. The whole sum of custom and the body of judicial precedents resist codification into a smart contracts, and this becomes even harder if your smart contract system has limits on the amount of processing power it can employ.  Fortunatley, some blockchain systems have shown themselves very capible of community based governance and adaptability.

Our solution will use a community governed, upgradable blockchain to build our system on.
