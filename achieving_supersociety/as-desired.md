### As Desired


If we had complete power to implement a system of our choice, how would it work?


I will define this and discuss how we can create a generative system that results in this system.



### The Center - The Citizen


First we must define what we want the 'center' of our system to be? Perhaps he market or the corporation like today's system seems to revolve around? Power and control as totalitarian governments have attempted to implement in the past?


I have concluded 'the citizen' should stand at our center. As I lay out this form of money I will ask the reader to consider each element layered on and ask themselves, 'how does this enhance the citizen at the center of our monetary system?' Along the way other centers will form around this initial strong center and we want each layer to enhance those sub centers as well.



Christopher Alexander explains hese ideas much more thoroughly in [Nature of Order](https://www.amazon.com/Nature-Order-Phenomenon-Environmental-Structure/dp/0972652914/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1484605072&sr=8-1&keywords=the+nature+of+order&linkCode=ll1&tag=everybase-20&linkId=897d28d5cd8ed759db14915a0dd4cfc7).


I should why we have not chosen something different as our strongest center. I will include a few notes, but there much longer discussion remains about the pluses and minuses of each. These non-citizen items may also arise as centers in our system, but they will not become the strongest center. They all have a role to play:


* The Government: We could certainly have the government at the center. In a sense The Fed does this today. They have the 'job' to maintain liquid markets so that things don't go insane among the populace. Things like the great depression make governing difficult. Ultimately though, even liberals don't want government as the centerpiece. Liberals may want a strong government but usually to the end that it help the citizens. The example of Soviet Communism also wards us away from trying to put too much stock in the government as the ultimate center.

* The Market: The economist will point to the market as the most pure incarnation of a center and that the market will take care of itself. The market! The market! But ultimately we have to make a choice. We can view the market as evolution businessified. It operates with a cold, calculating and merciless nature. Do we want to choose this kind of operation as our center? To date it has given the most benefit to the most people and generally pulled the least fortunate along for the ride, but I reject the assumption that we can't do better. Ultimately, I think mercy and grace and redemption surpass the market as worthwhile ideas. The market has no use of these. I find that the raw market lacks moral responsibility. We also find those that always seeking a market based solution lacking.

* The Company: The legal entity has been an amazing tool of capitalism. This amazing tool where people unite behind a purpose and pool resources toward that goal has much merit. My problem with the company, at least in the modern C - corporation incarnation resides in the fact that those that run the company are always held to make choices with the best interest of stockholder value in mind. Even if those choices would destroy or disrupt other essential centers in the economy(ie. the market, the government, the well being of the people, the natural resources), the board and the executives cannot legally make the center preserving choice. They must make the choice that maximizes the shareholder's value. They are barred from showing moral responsibility to the things that their corporation oversees unless they can make a bottom line justification.

We choose the citizen because without lifting up the citizen, these other institutions become meaningless. When these items have taken over in the past and become the end all be all, humanity has suffered. Sometimes from war, sometimes from oppression, sometimes from general lack of welfare.

I believe that if our system seeks to always put the citizen at the center then we will have created a successful economic system and monetary policy.

### A New Form of Money - Art

Around the center of the citizen we will add a new form of money. I propose to call this new coin 'Art.’ It should have a stable value and conforms to my ideas of democratic hypercatallaxy.

In short, this means 'Art' will:

* be traded for goods, but that in addition to the goods, the purchaser will receive a form of preferred stock called 'prefs' equal to the number of 'Art coins' that they spend.

* 'demurraged' or 'degraded' as a natural course to guard against the hoarding of money and as a means to pay a dividend to 'pref' holders and to collect taxes.

* used as a form of voting in society in which citizens can 'veto' the power of a government accounts to transact business, in effect, demanding change or requiring the reformation of the agency under different governance. The system limits votes to one per account and the number and the amount of cash in an account will not have a bearing on the number of votes a citizen has. Votes will be restricted to entities that the account has elected to pay taxes to in order to fund the agency.

Because of these properties, we use a digital currency, issued under an issuing authority. Physical bills do not exist in the system.

### Citizen Accounts

This money will need to be held in 'accounts.'

Not all accounts will be equal.

Citizens will have citizen accounts. These are the central accounts in the system. These accounts have the most power and freedom within the system.

An account will be issued to each 'citizen' that qualifies. Typically this will be a resident in a specific geographic area, although that definition may change over time. We define this as one human being though, and not a group of humans. One Citizen, one account.

### State Accounts

In my ideal scenario, the state issues the currency. The system may not start out like this, but I think that for the near future, this should be an end goal. Humanity will probably not throw off the concept of the nation state any time soon.

The State will have an issuing account and its agencies will have agency accounts. Sub governments like states and counties will have their own domain accounts and their sub agency accounts.

State accounts have the least amount of power because a group of citizens have the power to 'veto' the account and disable its use. Until the state or its agency comply with the demands of the citizens, or until a larger group of citizens overturns the veto, the agency cannot do business.

Citizens can elect to come under the domain of certain state type accounts. As an example, a resident of Texas coming under the Texas State account. The Texas state account will have its own set of taxes. Citizen can join many theoretical 'state' organizations. Another example might be a union that the citizen belongs to. They want a portion of their demurrage to go to the support of that union so they elect that account’s tax. They also gain voting rights over that account when they make this election.


### Legal Entities

Legal Entities will have Legal Entity accounts. Legal entity accounts have a bit less power than citizen accounts. The cannot vote and cannot initiate private transactions but can receive them.

In addition, Legal Entities submit to a demurrage of ownership. In exchange for Limited Liability, a portion of ownership in a legal entity will demurrage to the commons each year. This stock will go up for auction on a public marketplace. Bids will be taken. The highest bid will win the stock unless the original owners match the bid price. In either case, the amount paid for the stock will flow to the issuing authority to fund a majority of its operation.

### Domestic Passthroughs

The Domestic Passthrough account will allow domestic partners the ability to channel all household transactions and salary receipts through a centralized account. This structure will allow for the orderly dissolution and distribution of the prefs associated with such accounts if the domestic arrangement terminates.

### Transactions - Accountability and the Blockchain

Accounts will have a number of ways to transfer money around. Debit cards and online payment will be available. Transfer will execute as close to instantly as possible.

Transaction blocks will reside on a blockchain that will ensure the validity of the transactions and keep the state from fudging the numbers behind the scenes.

A lot of hand wringing has gone on about how to use cryptocurrency in a way that ensures exclusions of governments when it comes to the next form of money. Instead of trampling all over the idea of rule of law, I think we should use this amazing technology to keep rule of law accountable. In this system all government transactions will be public and searchable. In addition they cannot be reversed or made not to exist because the distributed blockchain will have a record of them. This allows us to have a strong central authority, but also one that citizens hold accountable.

The blockchain will not be centralized and will be distributed across a peer to peer network. In this way the entire transaction history will be stored off site and could be reconstructed in the event of catastrophe.

### Prefs

Each transaction comes with the assignment of prefs to the money contributing party. Prefs entitle the owner to a portion of the pref payment each account produces as money decays inside of it. If I receive a pref dividend from an account that I own prefs in, the smart contract will split it into 3 parts.

First the tax will be figured. Say my account's total tax rate is 25% and my payment is $100. $25 will be deposited in the state agencies that my tax flows into. If the pass through rate is 33%, the remaining $75 will be split into $25 and $50. I will receive the $50 in my account and the $25 will be 'passed through' to the accounts that own prefs in my account. This all occurs on a 'catch up.'

The central system will force accounts to catch up on a monthly basis, but generally accounts will catch up more often as they engage in commerce. A account cannot claim its pref payments, accept money, or pay money unless it catches up.

The motto is 'No cash without capital.' This will be the refrain of the consumer and will compel the rest of the economic system to move to our form of money.

### Demurrage

Where does this $100 payment come from? Consider the prefs accounts earn a form of preferred stock. Instead of getting a dividend off of the profits an account earns, a demurrage rate that the issuing authority sets to keep inflation near zero determines the pref dividend.

Demurrage is controlled inflation. It causes money to degrade in a straight line, expected fashion. If money demurrages in a state account, it ceases to exist. Other accounts distribute payments to the pref owners. When the payment processes, a portion gets collected as tax.

As a natural result, as an account does more and more business, it will distribute more and more prefs. When cash in the account decays, it will be distributed more and more broadly as time goes on. New accounts will eventually become reluctant to do business with older accounts as they will gain less of a share than by purchasing from newer accounts. The system produces a life cycle for an account. Accounts that have been doing business with the account for years will continue to do so. I see this pattern in human relationships and we think that extending it to the way we execute commerce will generate a more progressive form of commerce where companies evolve ways of doing business much more rapidly.

### A Replacement for Commercial Banking

The issuing state will also regulate the loan pool. The loan pool can work in a number of different ways and I'm not sure which should emerge as the dominant model.

The first way works in much the same way that the existing fractional reserve banking system does. The difference resides in citizens will reap the benefit of the loans instead of the banks.

All accounts will have a portion of their balance that becomes 'protected' from demurrage. This amount will aggregates and gets put up for loan by the central authority. A reserve requirement factor will multiply the amount available and that will allow us to issue an amount higher than in the pool. We keep enough money in the system by manipulating the reserve rate and the demurrage rate such that the market can purchase all that gets produced and yet still have a means to extract money from the system in times of crisis.

As an effect of demurrage, the interest rate will collapse close zero for short term loans. How then do we keep a run on the bank from occurring? And what should we do with all the out of work bankers? We will answer these questions in a later section.

A second method has the government issuing the loan pools to groups of loan officers in the same way that the fed currently issues money to commercial banks. This will likely require a higher demurrage rate so that the money can be pulled back out of the economy at a higher rate.

A third method lets loan pools emerge naturally. If the infrastructure provides for the tracking of loans a marketplace will emerge for collecting 'deposits' and issuing them out as 'loans' as banks do today. In this case the prefs would flow in the same way as our first proposal, but citizens will need to be more proactive to move their cash into these deposit type accounts.

### A New Kind of banker

Loan officers will bid for the rights to distribute the loans to the public. The system will distribute the winning bids the accounts that put up the cash to be lent out. In this way those that hold money can defray some of the demurrage value.

Why would loan officers bid cash on loans that make 0% interest? In issuing the loan, the cash will pass through the loan officers account and they will obtain prefs in the account that borrows the money. While the loan remains outstanding the loan officer will have skin in the game and will further help the account owner in commerce because they benefit directly. With enough success they can forgive a portion of the loan and convert it into a set of permanent prefs. In the current system, the banker loses interest as the loan balance goes to zero.

In a sense these new loan officers will become a type of long term venture capitalist. People who have access to cash and have demonstrated their abilities in commerce already will be drawn to this kind of roll.

### Enhancing Education

The modern world pays poor wages to educators. We do not adequately compensate teachers for the production they give to the world. To combat this the system will create a 'cohort fund' each school year. Each student gets allocated a set of prefs and the cohort fund gains that number of prefs in the student. Teachers also earn prefs in the cohort fund. This system drastically increases the long term earning potential of teachers. As students enter the workforce, their demurrage payments will begin accumulating in the cohort fund and pass through to all the teachers that helped teach them.

I understand that this may have some significant and ugly side effect such as teachers only wanting to teach in wealthy areas and only teaching successful students. Ways exist to correct these imbalances, perhaps by making the cohort pools statewide.

### Statutory Theft

Prefs cannot trade on the open market. Any entity or citizen that schemes to try to lay a claim on the value of prefs or to future revenue from prefs will be guilty of Statutory Theft. In a sense, the collected prefs become a part of a person and cannot be sold and no other entity can have dominion over them. In the same way that one cannot sell themselves into slavery, they cannot sell their prefs or the rights to the benefits of those prefs.  Without this restriction the system will revert to back to an oppressive nature where the strong have the upperhand.

### Modified Bankruptcy

Bankruptcy will change slightly for citizens. All existing capital can be wiped out from an account, but past a certain date, the 'clear out date', the creditors can lay no more claim on new income. The creditors can also not take the right to payments on past prefs earned in the future. Their payback must come from prefs earned after the bankruptcy date and via the prefs they own in the entity.

Corporate Bankruptcy will be very different. Bankrupt companies or companies that just go 'out of business' can have the blockchain folded over them in such a way that the prefs they own will be passed on to the entities that own prefs in them in proportion to the percentage of pref ownership.


### End of Life

A percentage of prefs will expire when a citizen or entity ceases to exist. This will refresh the pool of prefs for younger generations. The system should tightly restrict the number of prefs that pass through inheritance..

### Inflation Controls

A CPI authority will regulate inflation by recommending adjustments to the Demurrage, Retaining, Issuance, and Pass Through Rates. This authority will actually go out and buy a basket of goods in a broad set of geographic locations. This will determine the inflation rate. The system should strive to keep this number as close to 0 as possible.

### What Regulations?

Outside of these bounds, commerce and markets will operate much as they do now, free of over-regulation.

The 'software' in the smart contracts takes care of most of this without oversight and intervention. Citizens have access to the blockchain and can self regulate.

This  'dream state' may not emerge easily due to a number of assumptions that we will discuss in the next chapter.
