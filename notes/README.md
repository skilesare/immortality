# Notes

##Confusion

Dear Reader, before we can begin, we must discuss confusion.  Our journey together will be covering a significant amount of teritorry.  This will cause us difficulty because I am bringing my map to this terittory and you are brining yours.  This will cause significant strife and the next person you hand this book off to will have an even different brand of map.

Together, we must agree that the map is not the territory.  When my map says one thing and the territory I am covering says another, I am going to stop.  I'm going to redraw my map so that it matches the territory.  I'm going to do this to the best of my ability.  Often the computation of the territory will require more time than I have in my short life and I will instead make an approximation of the territory.  If I am successful, my map will be less confusing after this approximation.  If it isn't, I have failed.

As the author I will have a much easier time removing my confusiion than you will removing yours.  Such is a fault of typical books.  This book is not a typical book and is published as a git repository and I do accept pull request.  I will leave it to the reader to explore git repositories off line if they feel they have a contribution to make.  An added advantage to this is that one has the ability to go back and see how this work evolved.  I don't know how much information this will give, but if it helps clarify my meaning on even one occation than it is work its while since the technlogy makes tracking changes so easy.

As much as I want the content to hang together with a cohesive wholeness, I also want to help make everyone's map match the territory.  If we have to take a side-road we will.

To help facilite this I'll borrow a tool from "The Timeless Way of Building".  Each section will have **bold header that contains the meat of the section**. I would suggest reading through this book once and only reading the bold sections.  I will be able to do a much beter job at reducing your confusion if you know where we are headed.

I will use regular text to to provide the lengthier justifications.  Return to these once you know our general direction

Finally I will end with a section of *italicized text that will point to the potential rabit trails that we can go down to correct the many, many different maps that may exist.*  Because of these rabit trails, this book may never be "finished."  These sections can and probably should be skipped by most readers.

Often the map will be corrected using code simulation.  Code will be written in [Literate CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/#literate) in attempt to make the logic as readable as possible.  I will also attempt to provide runnable instances of the code that the reader can initialize and run with as few operations as possible.

##A definition of Toward

**There is nothing tricky in the way I am using 'toward' in my title of this book.  I believe there is an economics that can propel us toward a much, much longer life span for our minds.  This economics is not a magic bullet that can outstrip the laws of physics and the path from here to imortality being acheied may be a very, very long path. Also do not underestimate's mankind's ability to aim poorly. **

####On linear increase in life expectancy
####On Slope less than 1
####On Slope greater than 1
####On expoential life expectany
####On convex life expectancy
####On missing the mark

##A definition of Immortality

**When I speak of immortality I am speaking of a state of nature in which an intellegence has a reasonable expectation that it will continue to exist and operate, without defect or deteriorization, beyond a point in the future where technology can be expected to exist that can aliviate and heal any micro-defects.**

####On Why death is bad
####On Expectations
####On Accidents
####On Minds
####On Atoms
####On Immediate Hurdles
####On Macro-hurdles
####On the distant unseen


##A definition of Economics

####On Money
####On Desire
####On Value
####On Greed

> Reality, we have learned to our shock, is not a collection of separate magisteria, but a single unified process governed by mathematically simple low-level rules.

> So unless you can tell me which specific step in your argument violates the laws of physics by giving you true knowledge of the unseen, don’t expect me to believe that a big, elaborate clever argument can do it either.

> Unanswerable questions do not mark places where magic enters the universe. They mark places where your mind runs skew to reality.

> Surprise exists in the map, not in the territory.

> This, as I see it, is the thesis of reductionism. Reductionism is not a positive belief, but rather, a disbelief that the higher levels of simplified multilevel models are out there in the territory. Understanding this on a gut level dissolves the question of “How can you say the airplane doesn’t really have wings, when I can see the wings right there?” The critical words are really and see.

> It takes a strong mind, a deep honesty, and a deliberate effort to say, at this point, “That which can be destroyed by the truth should be,” and “The scientist hasn’t taken the gnomes away, only taken my delusion away,”

> They are savanna poets, who can only tell stories that would have made sense around a campfire ten thousand years ago. Savanna poets, who can tell only the Great Stories in their classic forms, and nothing more.
