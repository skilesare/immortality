Ha! I wrote the above even before reading Lila.  Wow.  Not sure what to say.  Probably randomness...but maybe wholeness.


-------------------------------


Foreces of Nature -> Find the force that ratchets up  but doesn't ratchet down - Carbon -> Biology -> finds the method that ratchets up but not back down -> natural selection...the blind god -> Society -> finds the force that ratchets up but not back down -> Written Law -> allows for the freedom to use intelect for other than survival -> enables intellect ->  What force does intelect use? The market is closes...maybe it is science...but science leaves out quality...so maybe it is the execution of science in a market context...but can't stay ratcheted up...is it wrtiting?  time?  Is the Blockchain part of that...adding writing and time into the market force? -> Intellect -> Super intellegence

It is value....quality at each level

inorganic -> valued: forces
biological -> valued: reproduction
social -> valued: resources
Intellectual -> valued: progress
superIntelligence -> valued: ?


The 50% tax of reproduction was worth the explosion in advancement to the next level.

Is there a second level:

inorganic -> valued: forces -> bio values: environment -> social values: architecture -> Intellectual values: utilitarian infrastructure(machinary?) -> SI values: sustainabile machinary

biological -> valued: reproduction -> social values: 'the group' -> intellectual values: immortality -> SI: diaspora?(spreading out)

social -> valued: resources -> intelectual values culture -> SI values: diversity?

Intellectual -> valued: progress -> ?
superIntelligence -> valued: ?

Maybe each level has classic/romantic unification that is better....maybe it isn't superintellegnece that wants sustaiable machinary..maybe it is just the evolved formof utilitarian infarastructure


What comes first in bootstrap is the classical...but it isn't perfected until the romantic is bolted on.

| | Inorganic (1) | Biological (4) | Societal (9) | Intellectual (13) | Super Intellegence | Super Society
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Inorganic | forces(2) / patterned forces(3) | environment (6) / structure (7) | architecture (16) / whole architecture (19)| machinery (18) / industry(21) | ?(sustainability) | ?(generative language)
| Biological | - | reproduction (5) / biodiversity (8) | grouping (11) / disbursement (12) | self preservation (15) / health(22) | ? (immortality) | ?(diaspora)
| Socital | - | - | resources (10) / money (20) | culture (17) / diversity(23) | ? (remembrance/peace) | ?(hypercatallaxy)
| Intellectual | - | - | - | observation(time?) (14) / science(24)(replayability?) | ? (whole science/value of the pursuit) | ?(Open Source)
| Super Intelegence | - | - | - | - | ? | ?

*Man appears at about 16.5

Biology mastering biodiveristy flowed over and bootstrapped the society layer and the intellectual layer.


Each of the above splits is really the base plus either value or quality or whole.  ie forces -> valueble forces, quality forces, or forces with wholeness.

You can actually go from left to right adding whole.

forces -> quality forces = patterned forces
patenred foces -> quality patterned forces = environment
environment -> quality environment = structure
structure -> quality structure(society context) = architecture
architecture -> quality architecture = whole architecture
whole architecture -> quality whole architecture => ?
structure -> quality structure(intelecutal context) = machinery
machinery -> quality machinery = industry
industry -> quality industry = sustainable industry


After the split from biology to Societal and Intellectual levels....do the merge in superintellegence?  or is that just a pushing beyond the intellectual.  What is beyond Societal?  Government?  yuck.

Super society should come before super intellegence. because those principals will bootstrap the super intellegence.
Contrarian:  The Super society should come after the super intellegence because then it will be immoral for the super intellegence to suppress the super society.


The key economic principle is identfying the proper structure that bootstraps the focus on value at a romantic/classical point up into the next level.  For example, focus biodiversity to a point where it is valued and you endup with multiple groupings.  Focus value on health to quality health and you bootstrap to imortallity.
