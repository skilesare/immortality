# WEL. Welfare

... How can we maintain human dignity **(DIG)** for the poor and disadvantaged?

**In all societies some will be disadvantaged. How can we provide for them?**


For the poor and uneducated the state should supply cash in the form of welfare.  As the poor spend this cash, they will earn prefs and should, after a time be able to maintain their own care.  In addition, once they educate and overcome their disadvantage, the state will recoup some of the cost by receiving pref payments from the citizens.

Therefore:

**Welfare should be paid in cash so that the prefs earned by the poor eventually ween them off of the system.**
