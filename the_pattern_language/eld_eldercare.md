### ELD. Eldercare

... How can we maintain human dignity **(DIG)** for the elderly?

**All citizens have the right to rest after a life of work and die with dignity.**

The principle of statutory theft should provide for a large amount of prefs being built up by citizens by the time they reach the end of their lives.  As a result, most should be able to provide for their own eldercare.  If not, the state should allow by rule of law the bequeathing of some portion of prefs to elder care workers that take care of a person in their old age.

If this person is a family member this portion should be in addition to the legacy portion that they can inherit and not included in it.  It would be wonderful if we were all free to take care of our parents as they took care of us when the time comes.

The amount of prefs that can be conveyed should be tied to the length of life so that there is never any advantage conveyed by death.

Therefore:

**Allow a portion of owned prefs to flow to those who provide elder care.**
