# INS. Instant Transfer


... How can a market **(MKT)** ensure the liquidity **(LIQ)** of money?

**Money that is tied up in processing or in a bank vault can cause a liquidity crisis.**

Our current cash settlement system is too slow.  In our new system money will need to change hands quickly.

Bitcoin and other 'proof' systems require a settlement time.  If our system can outperform that system it will have an advantage in adoption


Therefore:

**Provide for the instant transfer and useability of funds.**

Instant transfer can help secure the concept of Everyone is a Bank **(BNK)**.
