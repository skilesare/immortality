### PFP. Principle of First Pref Payment

... How do we bound the recursive nature of predistribution of economic rent **(PRF)**?

**In centralized markets, pref payments could recur from one market to another participant and back again.  How do we handle this?**

Each catch up should be issued an ID.  Pref payment from this ID can only hit an account once. The second time the account is hit in the pref distribution chain, the full amount should go to the selected taxing authorities.

Therefore:

**Only allow one payment in each catch up chain.**

----------

The principal of First Pref Payment is made possible with the public ledger **(PLG)**.
