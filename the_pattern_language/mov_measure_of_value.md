### MOV. Measure of Value

... how does one measure the exchange of goods with Money **(MNY)**? How can we encourage a Medium of Exchange **(MEX)**?


**Barter of goods suffers from the not needed fallacy.  Informal debt systems can be very hard to reconcile.  Money solves the this problem how?**

Money is an efficient way to measure value.  Since units of money are fungible, when one person offers X units for a good and another offers 2X, the good is measurable more valuable to the second.  This may seem a silly example, but 2 cows are not necessarily more valuable than 1 cow.  The 2 may be unhealthy or a different breed.

As much as it can, a new form of money should maintain this property.  1 unit should always be half as valuable as 2 units of the same currency.

Note:  We contend that a measure of value is different than a 'store of value'.  A measure of value can be achieved without there being a 'store of value'.  As we will argue later a 'store of value' is an artificial thing and not proper for the real world.

Therefore:

**Any form of money must be a measure of value.**

----------

Measure of Value is supported by  Divisibility **(DIV)**. Measure of Value can be strengthened by being made Legal Tender **(LTN)**.
