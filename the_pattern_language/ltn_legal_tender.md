### LTN. Legal Tender

... how can a state **(STA)** use Rule of Law **(ROL)** to help encourage the use of a new money. How can money **(MNY)** help implement deferred payments **(DPY)**, means of exchange **(MEX)**, and measure of value **(MOV)**?

**People in an economy need to know that the object they are using as money is a reliable instrument and will be accepted as payment.**

The state can declare an instrument to be legal tender, good for all debts public and private.  This is not necessary for a money to function, but lends credibility and increases the utility of a money

Therefore:

**Encourage the adoption of a new money as legal tender.**
