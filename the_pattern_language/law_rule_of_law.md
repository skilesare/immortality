# LAW. Rule of law

... how can a state **(STA)** enforce its desires and support its citizen's rights?

**A state without order is worthless and ineffective.**

The rule of law is important in the state.  Without it the state will not exist.

Many 'new money' schemes tend to try to create a currency outside the control of the state.  This will not work and those currencies will be plagued with nefarious uses.

Without the rule of law, a citizen can refuse a form of payment for a debt or for goods and services.

In addition, theft often has no recourse in classic cryptocurrency schemes. If cash is stolen and moved from one wallet to another by unlawful means, there is no way, other than force and torture to move the money back.  By integrating rule of law into our scheme for a new form of money we will allow the state to right wrongs.

What of state corruption and misuse of the rule of law?  This is a hard question to answer as the threat of overwhelming force has been the cause of many unjust acts by the state.  Our money must provide a way for the citizens to keep the government accountable.  The citizens must be the administer of rule of law on the government.  For that purpose we will later propose transparency by the government and the power of veto by citizens.


Therefore:

**Money must be subject to the rule of law.  This does not exempt the rule of law from  being accountable to its citizens.**

----------

Rule of law is established by the citizens **(CTZ)** and can be held accountable by public transparency **(TRN)** and the veto **(VTO)**.  It can establish Legal Tender **(LTN)** and the public ledger **(PLG)**. Rule of Law establishes the existence and rights of a Legal Entity **(LGE)** and enforces the payment of tax**(TAX)**.  Rule of law can also establish the formalness and regulatory level of Markets **(MKT)**. Rule of law can establish statutory theft **(STH)**.
