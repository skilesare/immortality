# LEG. Legacy

... How can the **(CTZ)** leave a legacy after death and ensure the full output of their labor **(FOL)** is left to that legacy?

**Humans have an innate desire to leave a legacy to their loved ones.  How can we provide for that without centralizing capital.**

We should provide for the inheritance of prefs, cash, and capital to descendants in a progressive manner.

We want productive citizens to act in their interest and the interest of their families. It is a core driver in our capitalism, but we must also provide for the fact that capital tends to concentrate.

A progressive a system of wealth tax should be implemented as an inheritance tax.

The government should not take control of inherited prefs.  Prefs eventually need to degrade to nothing as well.


Therefore:

**Establish a progressive inheritance tax.**
