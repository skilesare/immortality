# RTC. Resistant to Counterfeiting


... how can one ensure the money **(MNY)** cannot be falsely created or duplicated?


**If money is easily reproducible with no work or controls it will be come worthless?**

Money must be 'scarce'.  The scarceness of it, coupled with peoples trust in its value is what gives it value.

There must be a way to keep money from being 'created' in a nefarious and unofficial way.

Therefore:

**Money must be resistant to Counterfeiting.**

----------

Counterfeiting can be battled with the Public Ledger **(PLG)**.
