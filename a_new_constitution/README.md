# A new constitution

The following is a proposal for an updated constitution for the republic.  It preserves almost all of the existing constitution and only adds to it where there have are clear defficiancies and where we have needed to integrate the ideals of a hypercatallaxian economy into the fiber of the document.

It is all up for discussion, but we figured we needed to start somewhere.

It also allows for the self selection of states so that the republic can grow in an organic and natural state until all have elected to participate.
