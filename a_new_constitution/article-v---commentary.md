_Article. V._

_The Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose Amendments to this Constitution, or, on the Application of the Legislatures of two thirds of the several States, shall call a Convention for proposing Amendments, which, in either Case, shall be valid to all Intents and Purposes, as Part of this Constitution, when ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of the several States, or by Conventions in three fourths thereof, as the one or the other Mode of Ratification may be proposed by the Congress; Provided that no Amendment which may be made prior to the Year One thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any Manner affect the first clause in the Ninth Section of the first Article; and that no State, without its Consent, shall be deprived of its apportioned Suffrage in the Senate._


We are not suggesting any other methods of ratification at this time although we have considered a direct approval of ratification by citizens.
