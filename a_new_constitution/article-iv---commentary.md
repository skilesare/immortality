## Article IV - Commentary

This article speaks to the rights of member states in the republic.


_Article. IV._



_Section. 1._



Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State. And the Congress may by general Laws prescribe the Manner in which such Acts, Records and Proceedings shall be proved, and the Effect thereof.

No change.


_Section. 2._



_The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States._



_A Person charged in any State with Treason, Felony, or other Crime, who shall flee from Justice, and be found in another State, shall on Demand of the executive Authority of the State from which he fled, be delivered up, to be removed to the State having Jurisdiction of the Crime._

No change.

_Section. 3._

_
New Geographic States shall be admitted to the union by presenting a constitution based on a Republican Form of Government, a geographic bounds of the new state that does not encroach on any existing state, and when a quorum of 70% of the geographically elected accounts that have had residence in that geographic area for a consecutive period of more than 3 years have elected to pay the tax of the Government._


_Congress has the power to override the residency length restriction, but not the quorum or geographic clause._



_No new State shall be formed or erected within the Jurisdiction of any other State; nor any State be formed by the Junction of two or more States, or Parts of States, without the Consent of the Legislatures of the States concerned as well as of the Congress._



_The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the Government; and nothing in this Constitution shall be so construed as to Prejudice any Claims of the Government, or of any particular State._

The main change in this section speaks to the admissions of new states to the union. It is strictly given that it is an elective process and if 70% of the citizen accounts in that territory consent to become a state, then they shall become a state.  Congress does not have to admit them.  Congress can accelerate this timeline, but not override or make it harder for a territory to become a state.

_Section. 4._

_The Government shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government, and shall protect each of them against Invasion; and on Application of the Legislature, or of the Executive (when the Legislature cannot be convened), against domestic Violence._

No change.
