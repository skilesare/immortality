_Congress has the power to override the residency length restriction, but not the quorum or geographic clause._



_No new State shall be formed or erected within the Jurisdiction of any other State; nor any State be formed by the Junction of two or more States, or Parts of States, without the Consent of the Legislatures of the States concerned as well as of the Congress._



_The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the Government; and nothing in this Constitution shall be so construed as to Prejudice any Claims of the Government, or of any particular State._

The main change in this section speaks to the admissions of new states to the union. It is strictly given that it is an elective process and if 70% of the citizen accounts in that territory consent to become a state, then they shall become a state.  Congress does not have to admit them.  Congress can accelerate this timeline, but not override or make it harder for a territory to become a state.
