## Article VI - Commentary



_All Debts contracted and Engagements entered into, before the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be as valid against the Government under this Constitution, as under the Constitutions preceding ratification._

This is an important clause that applies to this new constitution in the same way it did when replacing the articles of confederation.  We want the transition to be a smooth and non-volatile one.



_Exception: All copyrights older than 50 years shall expire, All patents older than 21 years shall expire, All patents on non-material technology and software shall become open patents, and all patents provide protections that may lead to the reduction in quality or length of life of accounted citizens shall become open patents._

Here we explain that we will retroactively change copyright and patents.


_This Constitution, and the Laws of the Government which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the Government, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding._

No change



_The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the Members of the several State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial Officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution; but no religious, racial, occupational, gender identification, sexual orientation or genetic Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States._

Here we add in racial, occupational, gender identification, sexual orientation and genetic make up to the list of things that can't be used as discriminating factors.
