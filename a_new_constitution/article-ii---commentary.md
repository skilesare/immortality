## Article II - Commentary

This section discusses the roles and responsibilities of the executive branch of government



_Article. II.
_

_
Section. 1._



_The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the Government. They shall hold their Office during the Term of four Years, and, together with the Vice President, chosen for the same Term, be elected, as a ticket by ranked choice voting of all accounted citizens who have elected the Government._

We get rid of the electoral college and institute the true democratic election of the executive.

_Each elected President shall be limited to one full term of office, unless elected in a special election and then may be eligible for reelection. No Spouse, or genetic or adopted Brother, Sister, Parent, Son, Daughter, Grandson or Granddaughter of a President shall be elected to the office of President._

Here we limit the term of presidential office to one four year term so the president usually does not have to run for office while in office.  The exception is if the president is elected in a special election to replace a temporary president.

We also outlaw nepotistic presidential representatives.  With the millions of people in the country we surely don't need blood relatives and spouses standing on the shoulders of former presidents to keep power inside of families.

_The Congress may determine the Time of voting such that a window of two weeks is availibe where the final day of open voting is a national day of celebration and the Federal Government and State Governments shall reduce its business to a minimum level, and the time period on which the day shall be held will be the same througout the elected geography._

We institute a national holiday for voting for the president and mandate a two week early voting period.

_
No Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the elected geographies, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any Person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the elected territories._

No change.



_The President and Vice President must not have received private payments of cash or private allotments of capital for two years before taking office unless elected or assigned for a vacancy. The President and Vice President must elect to not receive private payments while in office and for ten years after leaving office._

Here we limit the ability to recieve private payments for those that would serve in office.

_In Case of the Removal of the President from Office, or of his Death, Resignation, or Inability to discharge the Powers and Duties of the said Office, the Same shall devolve on the Vice President, and the Congress may by Law provide for the Case of Removal, Death, Resignation or Inability, both of the President and Vice President, declaring what Officer shall then act as President, and such Officer shall act accordingly, until the Disability be removed. A special election to replace the temporary President shall be held no later than 6 months after the removal from office unless the removal occurs within 18 months of a regularly scheduled presidential election._


This schedules an emergency election if a president leaves power early enough in their term.


_The President shall, at stated Times, receive for his Services, a Compensation, which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the Period for which he shall have been elected, and he shall not receive within that Period any other Emolument from the United States, or any of them._

No change except to put the same restriction as is on congress.

_Before she enter on the Execution of the Office, she shall take the following Oath or Affirmation:â€”"I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the Government, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the Government."_

No change except the pronoun because it is about damn time.

_Section. 2._



_The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army, Navy, Marine Corp, Coast Guard, Air Force, and Space Corp of the Government, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of the United States; he may require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices, and he shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment._

No change except to add space.


_He shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur; and he shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law: but the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments._

No change.


_The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session._

No change.



_Section. 3._



_He shall from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient; he may, on extraordinary Occasions, convene both Houses, or either of them, and in Case of Disagreement between them, with Respect to the Time of Adjournment, he may adjourn them to such Time as he shall think proper; he shall receive Ambassadors and other public Ministers; he shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed, and shall Commission all the Officers of the United States._

_No change_


_Section. 4._



_The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.
